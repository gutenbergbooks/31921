<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">A</span><span class="caps">fter</span> returning from his first experience
in Alaska in 1900, the
author was prompted to write from his
diary, primarily for his friends, a sketch
of the rush to the Cape Nome gold-fields
and the character of the country and its
people. This account, with some modifications,
forms the first half of this book.
The second half, parts of which were
written in the atmosphere of the situations
as they arose during the following year,
has been recently completed upon the adjudication
of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Pacific Coast,
which, in effect, finally frees northwestern
Alaska from one of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
dramatic and oppressive conspiracies in
recent history.</p>

<p>The writer believes that the discovery
of this El Dorado of Bering Sea has
created an epoch in the development of
our national domain, wonderful and unprecedented
in various phases, and but
little understood or appreciated by the
general public. Because of its uniqueness,
it is a difficult matter to treat adequately.
Certain features of the subject
can hardly be exaggerated; for instance:
the magnitude and blindness of
the stampede of eighteen thousand fortune-hunters
in the summer of 1900, and
the almost indescribable scenes which
attended their arrival on the "golden
sands"; the marvelous richness of some
of the placer-gold deposits; the dreariness
and barrenness of the new country;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
and the enormity of the judicial conspiracy,
whose proceedings the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals has declared
"have no parallel in the jurisprudence of
this country."</p>

<p>Special laws concerning Alaska, the
local methods of mining, and various
other matters pertaining to the country
and its people, are dealt with herein,
probably with sufficient fullness for the
general reader. The book, however, as
a whole, is in narrative form; and personal
experiences and character-sketches
(especially in the second part) have been
freely utilized for the purpose of illustrating
characteristic conditions and typical
people.</p>

<p>If the narrative in places seems too
personal, this, perhaps, will be pardoned,
for the reason that an account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
actual experiences of a few individuals&mdash;tame,
indeed, compared with those of
many others&mdash;may better suggest the
atmosphere of a weird land than a mere
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of impersonal facts. Finally, it
is hoped that this book may, in some small
measure, prove of service in directing attention
to the past neglect and present
needs of our wonderful Alaska.</p>

<h4>THE RUSH IN 1900</h4>

<div class="figdrop">

</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">he</span> remarkable discoveries of
gold at Cape Nome, Alaska,
situated almost in the Bering
Strait, only one hundred and
fifty miles from Siberia, and distant not
less than three thousand miles from San
Francisco and fifteen hundred from the
famed Klondike, naturally created more
excitement in the Western and mining
sections of this country than in the Middle
States and the "effete East," an expression
frequently heard in the West. These
rich placer-gold deposits were discovered
by a small party of prospectors in the late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
autumn of 1898. The news spread like
wild-fire down along the Pacific coast and
up into Dawson and the Klondike country,
and the following spring witnessed a
stampede to the new El Dorado, which,
however, was wholly eclipsed by the unprecedented
mad rush of eighteen thousand
persons in the spring ensuing. During
the summer months of 1899, when,
in addition to the gold along the creeks,
rich deposits, easy to extract, were found
in the beach extending for miles by the
sea, every one at Nome had an opportunity
to share in nature's unexpected gift.
Consequently, upon the return in the fall,
the story of the wonderful wealth of this
weird country was circulated broadcast.
All kinds of schemes, honest and dishonest,
were devised during the winter to
obtain the gold the following season, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the matter of providing suitable laws to
meet the many difficult conditions and
questions which had already arisen, and
which would be greatly aggravated by
the threatened and succeeding stampede,
came definitely before Congress. Alaska,
legally, is not even a Territory, though
commonly so called. It is the District of
Alaska, possessing a governor and other
officers, but, unlike a Territory, no legislature;
and it is, therefore, entirely dependent
upon Congress for all legislation.
The Alaska bill, under the charge of Mr.
Warner in the House and Senator Carter
in the Senate, consumed a great deal of
the time of Congress; many of its provisions
were hotly debated, and finally it became
a law, June 6, 1900&mdash;in the main a
satisfactory piece of legislation. By it
Alaska was divided into three judicial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
divisions, and that which embraces northwestern
Alaska and the new gold-fields
was allotted to Arthur H. Noyes of Minnesota,
formerly of Dakota. If ever a
position demanded an honest, able, and
fearless man, it was this judgeship, which
should be the guaranty of good civil government,
establish a court, and disentangle
and dispose of, among a mixed population
largely composed of unscrupulous elements,
an indescribable mass of legal
matters, already accumulated and ever
increasing.</p>

<p>When in Washington in the winter of
1899, I became interested in Cape Nome.
I met there an able young attorney from
the Pacific coast, who among the first
had gone to Nome, where he had practised
his profession with great success
and secured interests in some promising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
properties. He was then in Washington
in the interest of Alaskan legislation.
The prospects for great legal complications
in the new country were highly
encouraging. Lieutenant Jarvis of the
United States revenue service, a man of
sound judgment and few words, who so
signally distinguished himself in 1897 by
his overland expedition and rescue of the
crews of whaling-vessels ice-bound in the
Arctic seas, had been the chief agent of
the government at Nome the preceding
year. He not only corroborated what I
had already heard, but gave the impression
that the story had not half been told.
My brother and I decided to make the
venture, and to be content with a safe
return and a fund of experience, to offset
the uncertain rewards of business and
law practice during the dull summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
months. He took up surveying, and I
spent all my spare time in studying the
elaborate codes of laws which Congress
was then enacting for Alaska, as well as
substantive mining law and all available
information pertaining to that little known
or understood country.</p>

<p>In San Francisco there were many
signs of the Nome excitement. "Cape
Nome Supplies," in large print, met the
eye frequently. One ran across many
who were going, and heard of many more
who had already started for the Arctic
gold-fields. All indications pointed to
the advent of a small army of lawyers
and doctors on the shores of Nome. But,
though there was a stir in the atmosphere,
the excitement was nothing compared
with that at Seattle, which is the natural
outfitting-point for Alaska; for San<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Francisco has had a long experience in
these "excitements," and treats each recurring
one with comparative indifference.
We took everything with us,&mdash;tents,
stoves, provisions, all sufficient to
enable us to live independently for three
or four months,&mdash;not to mention the
"law library" and surveying apparatus.</p>

<p>The <i>C.D. Lane</i> was the ship, named
after its owner, the prominent mining
man, who had backed up his belief in the
genuineness of the new country by investing
in it a great deal of money, and
who was now taking up in his boat machinery,
supplies, miners, and general
passengers, some four hundred persons in
all. The sailing from San Francisco,
and the scenes of farewell at the dock,
were both amusing and impressive. Ready
exchanges of repartee between the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and the dock were in order. Passengers
held up "pokes," small buckskin bags
for gold-dust, and cheerfully shouted to
their friends that they would come back
with their "sacks" full. But there was
about it all at the same time something
not altogether gay. It was no certain undertaking.
The great majority, of course,
would not return successful, and it was
not improbable that some might not return
at all.</p>

<p>I presume that the <i>Lane</i> carried in its
personnel an average assortment of the
eighteen thousand similarly brought to
Nome; perhaps, however, a higher average,
due to the fact that many of its passengers
went legitimately to work in the
employ of the Wild Goose Mining and
Trading Company, in which Mr. Lane
is largely interested. Nevertheless, students<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of human nature could there have
found an ample field for study in the
array of adventurers, gamblers, pugilists,
alleged actors and actresses,&mdash;a nondescript
male and female population, which
might very appropriately be collected
under the term "grafters"&mdash;an expression
commonly used to designate individuals
who ingraft themselves at the expense
of others. One of the first men we
met was V&mdash;&mdash;, who shared accommodations
with us. He was a practical miner,
who had prospected through nearly all of
the Western States and parts of Alaska,
and, like the great majority, he was going
to make a try at the new gold-fields, with
nothing assured, but with the determination
to strike out somewhere and "make
it." It did not take long to learn that
the real American miner, the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
undergoes hardships and endures privations
such as but few people can know or
understand, is a fine, intelligent, and generous
citizen, whom it is a pleasure to
know.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May the ship steamed
out of the Golden Gate and up the coast,
to stop <i>en route</i> at Seattle for additional
machinery, freight, and passengers,
though it was difficult to figure just
where the latter were to be distributed.
All ages are subject to the gold fever.
We met aboard ship a gentleman of our
own university, a classmate of Senator
Stewart, who, catching this fever in 1849,
without waiting to graduate, left New
Haven with Mr. Stewart in 1850, and
joined the pioneers in California. He
has since then been a Congressman and
held an important federal office. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ship's companions likewise had been
through the "early days" in the Western
country, and were now going to take
a look at the new El Dorado, but, I inferred,
rather as investors and investigators,
and not, like the majority, dependent
upon what the new country might
give to them. These people were worth
listening to in their continual discussions
as to the conditions to be met and the
opportunities to be grasped in the Nome
country. One of them I remember saying
that there would be more broken
hearts at Nome than in any other community.
And there were on the <i>Lane</i>
people who had staked their all upon this
venture, and who confidently believed
that, soon after landing, they could dig
out a small fortune. A number of these,
men with their wives, knew practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
nothing about mining. I recall a woman
of refinement from the South, who, with
her two sons, recently graduated from
college, was likewise in quest of a ready
fortune. She had never cooked in her
life, but thought it would be interesting
to look after her boys while they were
digging gold from the beach to empty
into their mother's lap. This sentiment
certainly betokened more hopefulness
than common sense. A few days after
their arrival at Nome, they departed for
home, having had all the experience they
wanted; and I subsequently learned on
my return that the mother had been confined
in a hospital for some time, suffering
from brain fever, a malady which it
is strange she could have contracted.</p>

<p>The <i>Lane</i> remained six days at Seattle,
and was one of the last boats to sail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
from that port for Nome. Everything in
Seattle seemed to be labeled "Cape
Nome"; it was in the air. General Randall
and the military were there, expecting
to sail for the North any day on the transport
<i>Seward</i>, the guardians and guaranty
of law and order in the new camp until the
inauguration of the civil authorities. The
lawyers were anxious to know the status
of the Alaska bill then under debate in
the Senate, especially with reference to
its provisions regarding the rights to
hold and mine the beach. This matter
proved, after all, to be of very little consequence,
as the beach had been practically
worked out the preceding season
and before the arrival of the 1900 stampede,
about two million dollars' worth of
fine "dust" having been taken from it.
But the bill became a law on the sixth day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of June, when we were on the high seas,
and the best that the goodly sized legal
fraternity represented on the <i>Lane</i> could
do was to discuss the proposed provisions,
and "what would you do in such a case?"
There was developing aboard ship a certain
nervousness to get away&mdash;people
wanted to arrive among the first, and
thought that they were losing valuable
time; but Mr. Lane, who had been at
Nome before, remarked that we should
arrive there none too late, and his judgment
proved to be sound.</p>

<p>Leaving Seattle June 3, with something
of a send-off and some interesting
additions to the passenger list, associations
with civilization were finally severed.</p>

<p>As it is problematical in the spring
just when the Bering Sea is free from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ice, the first objective point of all vessels
bound for the Arctic regions is Dutch
Harbor, Unalaska, one of the numerous
Aleutian Islands at the mouth, so to
speak, of Bering Sea, which extend in a
broken chain across the Pacific Ocean
almost to the coast of Asia.</p>

<p>The stretch from Seattle to this Bering
Sea harbor of refuge is twenty-one hundred
miles, and the route is not like that
of the delightful inside passage up the
Gulf of Alaska, by Sitka and the Muir
Glacier, replete with magnificent scenery,
and calm. On the contrary, it furnishes
nothing to gaze upon except the majestic
and not always sufficiently tranquil ocean.</p>

<p>There was, of course, on the <i>Lane</i> a
goodly representation of the genus "know-all,"
whose fortunes were really assured by
reason of an infallible combination which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
they held or device which they had contrived.
Such a combination was a certain
Alaska "syndicate," from the East, whose
component parts consisted of an ex-"judge,"
to decide the vital legal questions
which might arise in the acquisition
of property; an attorney, to search titles;
a general manager, who declared that he
didn't know gold from brass, but would
soon find out the difference; a couple of
engineers, and some others&mdash;not to mention
clever machinery with which to extract
gold, supplies of all kinds for a year
at least, and the essentials of a ready-made
house which could weather the
fierce winter Arctic gales. It was really
too good to endure long. Then, there
were individuals who could demonstrate
by their blue-prints just how the gold
was to be dredged from the sea, it being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to them a moral certainty that the gold,
probably emanating from the Siberian
shore, had been washed by the ocean
upon the beach. One of professed large
experience vehemently maintained that
his theory of the beach deposits was the
correct one; that is to say, the gold
came down the Yukon River attached
to the bottom of icebergs which were
carried out to sea, and then, somehow,
through the kindness of the Japanese
current, the gold which they brought was
deposited upon the long-extending beach
at Cape Nome! Of course, as had been
clearly demonstrated in the preliminary
United States geological report, the beach
gold had been carried down from the interior
by the streams emptying into Bering
Sea, and there distributed in the
black and "ruby" sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><p>The atmosphere became chill and penetrating,
the sunsets later, the nights
less dark. The crowd were kept in good
nature by sparring-matches conducted
along professional lines, mock trials, concerts,
and recitations by the "profession."
The popular song "Because I Love You"
was murdered several times daily, only
to be re-resurrected. We made the acquaintance
of another Yale man, Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;, a member of the California bar,
with whom I worked, weather and disposition
permitting, over the proposed
Alaska laws, and with whom I later
formed a law partnership.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of June 11 the
<i>Lane</i> went through Unimak Pass and was
steaming toward Dutch Harbor, all aboard
eager, with eyes straining, to see whether
the vessels which had preceded us were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
there, or had continued up into the Bering
Sea, navigation being open. To the surprise
and delight of nearly all, there lay
at anchor in that magnificent harbor,
almost landlocked, what appeared to be
the entire Nome fleet&mdash;steamers of all
sizes, sailing-craft laden with lumber and
black with passengers, and the United
States vessels <i>Wheeling</i>, <i>McCullough</i>,
<i>Manning</i>, <i>Rush</i>, and <i>Lawton</i>.</p>

<p>It is a weird and majestic spot. Great
hills, almost mountains, barren of timber
or shrubbery of any kind, and streaked
with snow, come down precipitous to the
water's edge. Rising beyond these are
snow-covered mountains. Not a tree nor
anything green is visible. The surface
is somber with the all-pervading tundra,
or Russian moss, which stretches over
the greater part of Alaska and northern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Siberia. Looking down the harbor are
discovered the large warehouses of one
of the great Alaska commercial and trading
companies, and the ancient and unique
Russian settlement of Unalaska, peopled
mainly by a mixed-breed population of
Russian, Japanese, and native Eskimo
constituents. There are a picturesque
little Russian church, and the Jesse Lee
Home for orphans and foundlings, endowed
by a number of charitable women
in Washington.</p>

<p>It was quickly learned that a number
of the more adventurous ships were
frozen up in the ice. Others were not
known about; perhaps they had found a
lucky opening and slipped through. Several
of the vessels then in the harbor,
essaying to get through, had met with
ice in quantity, and had discreetly returned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
A photograph taken by a passenger
on one of these latter ships, posted
up on the <i>Lane</i>, tended to chill the ardor
of some of the enthusiastic souls who
were for going right through and losing
no time in accumulating wealth. It is
safe only for wooden vessels, specially
fortified for the purpose, to "buck" the
ice, such as whalers and the United States
revenue cutter <i>Bear</i>, which was among
the first to arrive at Nome. The <i>Santa
Anna</i> had had a fearful time of it, having
been afire in the hold for four days,
reaching Dutch Harbor, however, with
no lives lost, but with all baggage
destroyed.</p>

<p>Naturally, every one was keen to be
ashore and to stroll about the island,
meeting friends who had come on other
vessels. Everything was "wide open."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Hastily-erected saloons and gambling
devices of all kinds were doing a flourishing
business, patronized indiscriminately
by the sexes; and there was a large run
on the stores for candies and sweets
generally. I trustingly gave to one
of the most intelligent-looking native
women some soiled clothes to wash.
When returned they were scarcely recognizable,
but she insisted that they
belonged to me. People were almost
universally complaining about the over-crowding
on their ships and the poor
food, so much so that we of the <i>Lane</i>
began to believe that we were living
strictly <i>en prince</i>. Some of the horses
which had been taken ashore were in a
pitifully cut-up condition, but nearly all
that I saw at Nome were splendid-looking
animals. Base-ball matches between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
nines picked from the various ships were
held, with the usual ensuing umpire difficulties.
After a while, however, the
novelty of the thing wore away. Under
the leadership of a certain "judge,"
prominent in the organization of townships
in Oklahoma, a party of us from
the <i>Lane</i>, half in jest and half seriously,
staked out, pursuant to law, a town site
to be known as "Lane City," and drew
lots for our respective real-estate holdings.
This move seemed to create some
little stir, and there appeared many who
wished to secure a lot in the new metropolis.
I believe that I am still the town
recorder; but it will be very strange indeed
if the law will suffer such transient
guests thus to create, and in absence
maintain, a town site, and the more especially
so when others claim the ownership<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of the property. As a matter of
fact, Dutch Harbor will very probably
become an important station in the Philippine
and Asiatic trade of this country;
and General Randall, in a recent report,
has strongly recommended the government
acquisition of land there for commercial
and outfitting purposes.</p>

<p>The weather had been somewhat misty
and chilly, with only occasional gleams
of sunshine. It was not disagreeable,
however, and at times was very pleasant.
The ships were daily setting out for the
North, and the <i>Lane</i> was delaying with
a number of others, awaiting the advent
of an expected collier. There were excitement
and curiosity, indeed, when the
<i>Cleveland</i> came in, the first large vessel
to discharge passengers and freight at
Nome and to return for a second trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Adventurous, she had taken advantage of
a lucky break in the ice, and had safely
gotten through and reached her destination.
The dock was crowded with people
seeking interviews with those returning
on the <i>Cleveland</i>. The latter were, for
the most part, a poor-looking collection,
who told dire and terrible tales of the
Nome "fake" and of the lawlessness
and crime existing there. They said that
the beach had been exhausted of its gold,
and that people were leaving for home as
quickly as the steamers would take them
or they could scrape up enough money
to pay their passage. To those especially
who were relying upon getting ready
money from the beach this news was not
reassuring.</p>

<p>On June 17 the <i>Lane</i> withdrew from
Dutch Harbor and headed up into Bering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Sea. Whales were frequently seen,
sometimes very close to the ship, and we
occasionally skirted around fields of ice.
A matter about which we particularly
wished to know, and regarding which
the testimony of experts was sharply
conflicting, was just what kind of a climate
is that of the Nome country. Some
said that it was chilly and that it rained
all the while, and that rubber boots and
oilskins were always essential; a former
whaling captain, with whom I could talk
New Bedford, said that frequently during
the middle of the day the sun was so
hot as to be almost unbearable. But as
to knowing anything at that time, the
weather proposition was a gamble. Since
the coming of the <i>Cleveland</i> there could
be detected among the "syndicate" a
certain lack of enthusiasm, as evidenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
by a few chance remarks about the comforts
of home, and a less sprightly step
and challenging eye. But, generally, on
nearing the destination, the crowd aboard
ship were in good spirits, though, naturally,
somewhat more serious. It was
now practically perpetual daylight.</p>

<p>The first sight of Nome City, as we
steamed toward the place in the clear
morning light of June 20, was impressive.
It was indeed a "white city,"
tents, tents, tents extending along the
shore almost as far as the eye could see.
Scattered in the denser and more congested
part of the town were large
frame and galvanized-iron structures,
the warehouses and stores of the large
companies; and there was the much-talked-of
tundra, upon which the multitude
were encamped, extending back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
almost from the edge of the sea three or
four miles to the high and rolling hills,
which bore an occasional streak of snow.
Not a tree, not a bit of foliage, nothing
green, was in evidence. Had it not been
for the chance discovery of gold in that
remote spot, one passing along the coast
would have considered it barren and forlorn,
"a dreary waste expanding to the
skies." There is not even the semblance
of a harbor. It is a mere shallow roadstead
open to the clear sweep and attack
of the Bering Sea. Anchored from one
to two miles from the shore were strung
along, I may say, scores of nondescript
steamers and sailing-craft, with here and
there a tug towing ashore lighters filled
with passengers or freight, or bringing
them back empty. These tugs were so
few that they could command almost any
price for a day's use, and proved veritable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
gold-mines to their owners. When
the sea is at all rough no disembarking
can be done. We were in great good
luck to have at that time an unprecedented
spell of clear weather and calm
seas, which tended to lessen the confusion
and misery, which were, even under
those favorable conditions, only too great.</p>

<p>Well, here we were finally and at last,
and now to face the music! Bundled
into scows, passengers were towed by the
light-draft boats to within some thirty
feet of the shore, and then the scows were
allowed to drift in upon the moderate
but wetting surf. Women were carried
ashore on the backs of men who waded
out to the lighters; and the men, for the
most part, completed the remaining distance
in their rubber boots, or got wet, or
imposed upon the back and good nature
of some accommodating person.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h4>THE HYBRID CITY OF NOME</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropt.jpg" width="100" height="106" alt="dropt" title="" />
</div>
<p class="noin"><span class="caps">he</span> town forms dense right
at the shore, extending back
and along upon damp and
muddy soil hitherto covered
by the deep and marshy moss. The
Snake River, a sluggish, unnavigable
stream, coming from the back-lying hills
and through the tundra, empties into the
sea where the town tapers off at the
north, and thereby forms a sand-spit.</p>

<p>The first impressions after landing were
those of confusion, waste, and filth. The
shore was an indescribable mass of machinery,
lumber, and freight of all kinds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the greater part of which represented
fortunes thrown away. Scattered about
and along the shore, looking for an opportunity
to steal, were as tough a looking
lot of rascals as one could meet.
Upon walking into the center of the
town one was greeted by a sight which
beggars description. Certainly it was a
case of "whited sepulcher." The whiteness
viewed from afar disappeared. The
main street was lined with hastily-erected
two-story frame buildings, with here
and there a tent&mdash;a series of saloons,
gambling-places, and dance-halls, restaurants,
steamship agencies, various
kinds of stores, and lawyers' "offices."
It was filled with a mass of promiscuous
humanity. Loads of stuff drawn by
horses and dog-teams were being carted
through the narrow, crowded ways, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the cry of encouragement to the dogs of
"Mush on" (dog French for <i>Marchons</i>)
was heard frequently. Miners
with heavy packs on their backs were
starting out for the claims on the creeks
and into the unknown interior, but the
"bar-room" miner was far more in evidence.</p>

<p>It was not the typical mining camp
where the population for the greater
part is composed of hardy, honest people
who have undergone privation to reach
their destination, and thereby represent,
in a measure, the survival of the fittest;
for this was a great impossible hybrid
sort of city, accessible by steamer direct
from San Francisco and Seattle, where the
riffraff and criminals of the country were
dumped, remote from the restraints of law
and order. I heard old-timers who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
visited all the principal mining camps in
recent years remark that this Nome was
the "toughest proposition" they had
ever encountered, and I must admit that
it would be difficult to picture anything
tougher. However, it was soon realized
that the matter to be reckoned with was
that of sanitary conditions, or rather the
lack of them. The general "toughness"
of things and the inconveniences of getting
settled had been in the main foreseen
and discounted, but the rather
alarming outbreak of smallpox in the
camp, and the reported filling up of the
"pest-house," made matters somewhat
more involved and complicated. There
had been a warning in Seattle that certain
vessels were bringing up persons infected
with the disease, and two of the
suspected ships were then being held in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
quarantine by the vigilant government
representative, Lieutenant Jarvis, but the
disease had, nevertheless, secured a foothold
in the camp. Undoubtedly, however,
the matter was grossly exaggerated,
and there were probably more deaths from
pneumonia than from any other disease.
The smallpox scare, nevertheless,
gave the doctors a good opening, for
vaccination was strictly in order. Considering
in retrospect the site of the
place, the total absence of any sewerage,
and the great motley crowd there herded
together, Nome proved to be a remarkably
healthy camp&mdash;a fact due, in the main,
to the prompt measures for sanitation
taken by General Randall immediately
upon his arrival, and the introduction into
the town, later in the season, of good
water conveyed by pipes from the streams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
beyond. During the preceding year typhoid
had been very prevalent and deaths
numerous. A repetition was thus happily
avoided, though, during the first days
the prospects seemed indeed dismal, and
the old-timers (always spoken of as
"sour doughs" in Alaska) predicted
that, after the rains should set in, the people
were going to die like flies; and, without
the least exaggeration, it certainly
looked that way. I believe, nevertheless,
that if the story could be told, it would
be learned that more lives have been lost
in that country through drowning than
in any other way. Hundreds of gold-hunters,
in small and unseaworthy boats,
as soon as they could do so, left Nome to
prospect the remoter coast and possible
creeks, many of whom perished in the
sudden and fierce storms which occur in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the Bering Sea, and wives and mothers
wondered why no letters came from
Alaska.</p>

<p>We were four or five days collecting
our seventeen packages of freight, and
with V&mdash;&mdash; took turns day and night waiting
for the uncertain lighters to come
ashore with their mixed loads of machinery
and miscellaneous supplies. I
believe that between us we saw and examined
every parcel which came from the
hold of the <i>Lane</i>. C&mdash;&mdash; was ill aboard
ship, and we looked after his freight as
well. Some days it was too rough to
discharge any, or a tug could not be
secured or had broken down. It was
good luck finally to get it all, for
many were left high and dry with nothing,
their vessels having returned for a
second trip with cargo not wholly discharged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
During these nights&mdash;or what
should have been nights&mdash;we were fortunate
to have extended to us the hospitality
of the floor of the storehouse of
the Wild Goose Mining and Trading
Company, and I can very distinctly recall
the stretched-out, blanketed figures lying
about, the coughing of a sick Eskimo
family in the attic above, and the yelling
of the fellow across the way exhorting
people in the ever-restless street to enter
the dance-hall and see the "most beautiful
women in the world."</p>

<p>Until our tents and provisions could be
collected, it was necessary to live, so to
speak, "on the town," but restaurant competition
was already so keen that one
could get a really excellent and clean
meal for a dollar and a half or a dollar.
I drank no water at all, unless it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
been boiled, and then took it with tea.
It is possible thus to accustom one's self;
but I distinctly remember being on one
occasion so thirsty as to give fifty cents
for a glass of ginger-ale, and poor at
that. Despite our special vigilance in
watching our freight as it accumulated
on the shore, in an unguarded moment,
when our backs were turned, one of the
numerous thugs stole V&mdash;&mdash;'s valise, containing
many essentials and keepsakes of
the miner which could not be replaced. The
calm, manly manner in which he bore his
great loss, for which my brother and I
felt partly responsible, was an excellent
example for us when, on the morrow, we
similarly had stolen from us the sack
which contained our invaluable sleeping-robes,
made from army blankets, things
which we missed all summer, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
lack of which made us mentally sore.
Of course, among such an assortment of
persons, there were a number of murders,
suicides, and indulgences in "gun-play,"
and it was not precisely the proper thing
in the small hours to stroll carelessly
about the place.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1900 a "strike"
had been made at Topkok, a small stretch
of beach some thirty miles east of Nome,
near the mouth of a dry creek called
Daniel's. Four men with primitive contrivances
had taken out at least forty
thousand dollars' worth of gold-dust in
thirty days, when the secret leaked out,
and a stampede to that quarter ensued.
Small vessels of all kinds, charging from
fifteen to twenty-five dollars a passenger
and a good deal for freight, were making
the trip, crowded, between Nome and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
new diggings. It was generally conceded
that all the ground along the creeks back
of Nome, and the tundra, had been staked
and restaked for many miles; in fact, nearly
all the surrounding country had been
gobbled up, on speculation mainly, after
the rich discoveries on Anvil and other
creeks. There had been a rush to Port
Clarence, forty miles north and west, but
it was common belief that no gold had
been discovered there, and that it was a
mere real-estate boom and a fake excitement.
Cape York, thirty miles beyond
Port Clarence, which had been reported
rich the preceding fall, and where it was
believed there would be a considerable
and prosperous settlement the following
season, had not panned out successfully.
The beach about Nome had been already
practically exhausted, so that it yielded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
in its best spots only a few dollars a day,
an amount which does not go very far in
a new country. It was, therefore, a serious
question for the average miner to decide
in what direction and how he should
move. Undoubtedly, the poverty of the
beach, which was considered common
property, was a keen disappointment to
the many who had hoped to take from
it sufficient wherewithal to tide them
through the winter and furnish a little
capital for future operations. The working
season is short, scarcely three months,
as operations must practically cease
when the water freezes; and one must
"strike it" early, or not at all. Hundreds
of the adventurers immediately
threw up the sponge, cursed the Nome
"fake"; and, if they could pay the fare,
departed for home. The steamers for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
most part were returning as crowded as
they came, and many of their passengers,
on reaching home, exaggerating the sufficiently
bad conditions which did exist,
immediately circulated in the press of the
country most alarming accounts of the
situation at Nome, and also generally
condemned as a fraud a country marvelously
rich in gold, a country which they
had not given even a decent trial.</p>

<p>Having finally collected the bulk of
our freight, we put up a tent on the sand-spit
across the Snake River, half a mile
perhaps from the heart of the metropolis,
the only ground except the beach which
was not tundra. This place was already
becoming thickly populated with temporary
tenants like ourselves, small stores
of various kinds, and lodging-tents, not
to mention a fat individual near us who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
decorated and bedecked with medals,
hung out her sign&mdash;"Lady Barber."
Our camp was about fifty yards from the
ocean. Driftwood from Siberia, tossed
up by unusually severe storms, lay about
in quantity. V&mdash;&mdash;, with his mining partner,
R&mdash;&mdash;, camped with us, and all took
turns in guarding the provisions, cooking,
and doing camp chores generally,
during this period of deliberation. At
times during the day it was very warm,&mdash;the
sun blazed down hot,&mdash;but toward
six o'clock in the evening it became chilly,
and at night it was positively and uncomfortably
cold; for, be it remembered, all
through that section of the country, a
few feet from the surface, and this, too,
in the case of the tundra, perennial layers
of ice and frozen ground are met. Putting
a flooring to the tent, and the purchase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of some reindeer-skins to fill the
want caused by the "lifting" of our
sleeping-robes and the mysterious disappearance
of the folding cots, made the
nights much more agreeable, and, furthermore,
we were becoming inured to
the climatic conditions. The midnight
sun stood up in the heavens small and
red like a toy balloon; and it was the perpetual
daylight, aggravated through the
whiteness of the tent, which, aided by
the cold, made those first nights almost
sleepless ones. Near us, living in a
small hut fortified with driftwood and
canvas, was a queer little old German-American,
who was one of the pioneers
in the Nome region. He was addressed
as "Captain Cook," and, with a twinkle
in his bright eye, he referred to his abode
as his "castle." We secured his good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
will, and the old fellow related some
of his interesting experiences. He said,
now that he had accumulated some gold,
he was going home in the autumn to see his
"leetle wife in Kansas City," whom he
had not seen for many years.</p>

<p>Westward along the beach, for miles,
all kinds of contrivances, from the simple
hand-"rocker" to complicated machinery,
were being used to get the gold; but the
men did not seem cheerful in their work,
and most of them would freely and candidly
admit that they were not making
even good wages. Among the many
strange sights on the beach was an enormous
machine, built upon huge barrels,
which some of our friends with the blue-prints
were making ready to dredge gold
from the sea. It represented a great deal
of money. When subsequently launched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and tons of sand had been taken by it
from beneath the sea, not five cents' worth
of gold was found to compensate for the
enormous expense and labor. Not far
away, at a point which was to be its terminal,
men were landing as best they
could the machinery, rails, and ties for
the railroad of the Wild Goose Company,
which was to extend for several miles
back over the tundra to the rich placer-mines
on the creeks.</p>

<p>Hundreds were living in tents upon the
beach, thanks to the clemency of the
weather. Within a very short distance
from our camp, with their freight piled
about, were the "syndicate," and quite
unenthusiastic. There was defection in
their camp. Actually, the "syndicate"
were selling out, and without a struggle.
Several of its members very soon bade us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
farewell, and pulled out for what they
thought the "real thing"&mdash;quartz-mines
in Oregon. And yet some of the mines
on Anvil Creek even then, and with only a
few men shoveling the pay dirt into the
sluice-boxes, were turning out from ten
to fifteen thousand dollars a day. To be
sure, this was for the very few only, but,
at the same time, it went to prove that the
country was not a fraud. Even the dirt in
those miserable Nome streets contained
"colors," or small particles of gold; and
it is an incongruous thought that, of all
the cities of the world, Nome City, as it
is called, most nearly approaches the
apocalyptic condition of having its streets
paved with gold!</p>

<p>We daily crossed the Snake River on
"Gieger's Bridge" when going into the
town for investigation and information.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Gieger was an enterprising fellow who
had built a rough but sufficiently substantial
bridge at the mouth of the
stream, and, by exacting a toll, he was
making a pretty good thing out of it.
Frame buildings of the wood of Puget
Sound were going up like mushrooms
throughout the town, and the noise of
saw and hammer denoted that the carpenters
were making small fortunes.
"Offices" which could scarcely hold more
than a chair and a table were for rent at
one hundred to one hundred and fifty
dollars a month, and these, too, frequently
were merely spaces penned off
in connection with stores or bar-rooms.
Absurd prices were demanded for town
lots of very uncertain title. I know of
one instance where four thousand dollars
was given for a lot on the main street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The saloon which bore the proud sign
"The Only Second-Class Saloon in Alaska"
seemed to be the best appointed and
to be playing to the largest audiences;
but it was then too early for the miners
to come in with their gold dust, and the
gamblers, therefore, were not doing a
harvest business. We met college-bred
men. A man I had known at college
was doing business in a tent pending the
building of a bank with safe-deposit
vaults, of which he was the general manager.
Another, with whom I had attended
law school, and whom I had never
seen or thought of since, had come to
Nome in the first rush from Seattle, and
now, situated in Easy Street, was one of
the leaders of the Nome bar. The negro
Pullman-car porter, whom we had last
seen at San Antonio, Texas, on our way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
out from the East, reintroduced himself
to me on the street, to my infinite surprise,
and wanted to know if I could give
him work of some kind, which I was not
then in position to do. We may have
been responsible for his infection with
the gold fever.</p>

<p>The place was really under martial
law. The town government, useless and
corrupt, was practically nil; and as it was
believed that the federal judge, with his
staff of assistants, would not arrive until
August, it was the plain duty of the military
to preserve order and, so far as possible,
leave legal matters <i>in statu quo</i>
until the advent of the civil authorities as
provided by the laws which had been recently
enacted for Alaska.</p>

<p>For various reasons which seemed good
and sufficient, we decided to quit Nome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and go to Council City. We knew that
Mr. Lane's company had large interests
in that region&mdash;that he believed in it;
and we knew people on the <i>Lane</i> who
had gone thither direct on reaching
Nome. It was said, too, to be a healthful
country, with plenty of good water
and even a belt of timber. One did not
hear it much discussed at Nome&mdash;people
did not seem to know much about it,&mdash;but
what was said was favorable. As
to the means of reaching it, information
was scanty, and that somewhat discouraging,
but certainly the thing to do was
to go by boat east about seventy-five
miles to the mouth of Golovin Bay, from
which point we should have to travel up
shallow rivers some fifty or sixty miles to
Council City. C&mdash;&mdash;, who had been a
pretty sick man, but who had declined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
follow certain "sound advice" and return
home (having joined us from the <i>Lane</i>),
and G&mdash;&mdash;, another fellow-passenger,
thought the move a good one, and agreed
to come with us. We four, therefore, making
selections from our respective supplies,
sold or otherwise disposed of provisions
which were less essential, for the
carrying of freight and supplies in that
impossible country, however short the
actual distance, is a very serious and expensive
matter. V&mdash;&mdash; and R&mdash;&mdash; were
building their boat, though they had not
yet decided in which direction to go; but
they agreed to communicate with us somehow
during the season. A tent labeled
"Undertaker," with the American flag
on top, had just been put up for business
across the way from us; and it seemed
fitting that we should celebrate the Fourth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of July by leaving Nome. This was
accomplished on the little steamer <i>Dora</i>,
belonging to the Alaska Commercial
Company, not much to look at, but it
afforded the greatest comfort and luxury
we had known since the days at San
Francisco, and, furthermore, it carried
drinkable water.</p>

<h4>TRAVEL TO THE INTERIOR</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropl.jpg" width="100" height="103" alt="dropl" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">eaving</span> Nome in the evening,
by the following noon
we were off a small settlement
comprising a few scattered
sod houses, warehouses, and tents, called
either by the Indian name "Chenik," or
"Dexter's," after the pioneer who lived
there with his Eskimo wife and children.
Dexter had settled at Chenik a number
of years ago, and was making money
by trading with the natives, when, in the
autumn of 1898, the discovery of gold at
Nome made him a very rich man. He
was among the first to secure valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
claims. Chenik, as I prefer to call it, is
a sand-spit in the entrance to Golovin
Bay, a large and shallow body of water
with treacherous mud-flats, surrounded
by great barren hills and the all-pervading
tundra. Not a tree is to be seen,
but rising immediately behind the scattered
settlement is a steep hill, less somber
than the rest, upon which the occasional
wooden bier of a departed Eskimo
makes the scene less monotonous. There
is a small Swedish mission, in charge of
a good man, Mr. Hendricksen, who was
looking after the welfare of fifty or sixty
natives there encamped. The entire picture
is far more cheerful than that of
Nome. Until further and more definite
information concerning our destination
could be gathered, we made temporary
camp on dry ground not far from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
shore, fortunate in being able to borrow
some loose boards for a flooring. The
weather certainly had been and was very
good to us, the days bright and clear
and, at times, quite warm, but the nights
always cold.</p>

<p>Generally, what was learned about the
Council City country was far from reassuring.
Men who seemed to be of a
sturdy, reliable sort, and who said that
they had been there, reported that it was
not worth while, and dilated upon the
arduous work of dragging one's self and
one's boat up the shallow streams, eaten
up by mosquitos, to find everything staked
and nothing doing. I recall a Hebrew who
made us a visit, and, almost with tears in
his eyes, entreated us not to blight our
young lives by going to Council City;
and what a chapter of horrors he detailed!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
He maintained that we should
go to Eagle City, about fifteen hundred
miles distant via the Yukon River, where
nuggets as large as one's fist lay carelessly
about, and where there was a great
field for lawyers. He insisted that we
take his picture, in order that in the future
we could point to it, saying, "This is the
man who advised us <i>not</i> to go to Council
City." It was subsequently learned that
this gentleman had gone half-way to
Council, and no farther. We met some,
however, who believed it to be a good
country, and who were making ready to
set out for it. To get freight up the
rivers a narrow and shallow boat is essential,
and such a craft, twenty-two feet
in length, was quickly and dexterously
knocked together out of rough lumber by
two enterprising carpenters who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
doing a land-office business. Each one of
us became a quarter-owner in the <i>Mush-on</i>,
as the boat was christened.</p>

<p>Living at Chenik was not agreeable,
and we were willing to tackle Council
City anyhow. We four, together with
the more valuable of the supplies, occupied
a ten-by-twelve tent, and the water
proposition was worse than that at Nome.
It meant a long walk up a hill past
the Indian graves and along the high
cliff descending steep to the water's edge,
to a crevice in it which held a bank of
frozen snow. This was brought back in
buckets and melted, and, for drinking
purposes, boiled and filtered. Then, too,
the general epidemic of sickness which
prevailed during the season of 1900 among
the natives throughout northwestern
Alaska was here manifest. They all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
coughed, and while we were at Chenik
there were several deaths from a complication
of measles and pneumonia. Two
young Swedish women, belonging to the
mission, were faithfully ministering to the
sick, for the Eskimo is as helpless when
ill as are the members of his household
to care for him. Later, Dexter found
a dozen of the unfortunates dead across
the bay, and tumbled their remains into a
single grave.</p>

<p>It is estimated to be fifty miles from
Chenik to Council City&mdash;twelve miles
across Golovin Bay to the mouth of the
Fish River, which in delta form debouches
into the bay, and the remaining distance
up the Fish River and the Neukluk (the
Indian name for river-flowing-from-the-west),
a tributary nearly as large as the
main stream. White Mountain, a spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
where the Wild Goose Company has a
storehouse, a depot for its mining claims
above, is about half the way from Chenik
to Council, and is the head of navigation
for the several small, light-draft stern-wheelers
which occasionally make the trip
in the interest of the larger mine-owners.
It lessens the strain tremendously to get
a lift or a tow from one of these boats;
and, having obtained the good will of the
crew of the <i>Arctic Bird</i>, and strengthened
it by a bottle of whisky, we got what we
wanted. The <i>Mush-on</i> we had, so to
speak, tarred and feathered, and made
water-tight and filled with our freight, as
much as it could safely contain, the remainder
being stored in the <i>Arctic Bird</i>.
We were about to put our boat in tow
and set out, when who should suddenly
appear upon the scene but our two friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the <i>Lane</i>, H&mdash;&mdash; and T&mdash;&mdash;, with their
boat, just returned from Council, looking
very tough and very seedy. We were
exhorted to reconsider our plans, and as
these were mining men whom we knew,
whose judgment was entitled to respect,
we promptly did so. As the freight was
being taken off, though they were very
good about it, the triumvirate crew of the
<i>Arctic Bird</i> were not a little bit amused,
for of course it looked as if we had lost
our nerve at the last minute. The returned
prospectors had been disappointed
in a piece of ground upon which they had
a "lay" or lease, which fact, in the main,
accounted for their premature departure
and the lugubrious view which they took.</p>

<p>So we camped again at the same spot
and deliberated. Finally, in the evening
of July 15, we set out, T&mdash;&mdash; transferring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
himself to us, and G&mdash;&mdash; remaining
with H&mdash;&mdash;, the two latter having
decided to get somehow to St. Michaels,
thence up the Yukon to the Tanana
River, where a strike had been reported,
and big game was said to be abundant.
As a matter of fact, they were
obliged to remain at Chenik for a considerable
time on account of the quarantine
which all ports had against Nome and
vessels which had touched there.</p>

<p>The <i>Mush-on</i> was the last of the string
in tow, which consisted of a small barge or
lighter, containing Wild Goose Company
machinery, and the boats of several others,
who were also going up the rivers. My
brother steered the barge, and C&mdash;&mdash; our
boat, according to instructions from the
captain. T&mdash;&mdash; and I, who felt used
up, lounged on some sacks near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
warm engine. After running upon and
backing off various mud-flats, at midnight
the <i>Arctic Bird</i> rested at the
delta of the Fish River, and all hands
drank coffee, and the whisky which
represented our fare. It was, of course,
daylight,&mdash;a weird, grayish effect,&mdash;and
fairly, but not disagreeably, cold. Then
we entered and pushed slowly up the
swift and shallow stream, the mosquitos,
for the first time in our wanderings
to date, making themselves manifest
and felt. All of us had the same thought
and sensations. For the first time there
was a semblance of "God's country."
The beautifully clear stream,&mdash;flanked on
each side by scrub willows and an occasional
small spruce-tree,&mdash;whose tempting
water one could dip up and drink <i>ad libitum</i>,
seemed in places filled with fish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
darting swiftly about above the gravel
bed. Hills that appeared more like
mountains loomed up in the distance,
gray in the early light. There was the
inevitable tundra, of course, but it seemed
less all-pervading&mdash;it had finally met
with some competition.</p>

<p>There were many curves and sharp
turns where the boats in tow would have
been wrecked but for the men who,
wrapped in their sweaters and coats,
steered them. Many times the <i>Arctic
Bird</i> would run upon a riffle (where the
water runs very shallow over the gravel),
to be temporarily baffled and obliged to
back off and seek another course. The
stream averaged hardly two feet in depth.
Frequently the fraction of an inch meant
progress or failure. When in plain sight
and almost in reach of White Mountain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that fraction of an inch was not in
our favor, and it being then three o'clock
in the morning, anchor was thrown out,
and all hands turned in to await the coming
of the tide below, the crew pulling
out their mattresses, and the "cheechawkers"
(the Eskimo name for newcomers,
universally used in Alaska) conforming
their shapes to the various sacks and
baggage. By noon we were disembarked
and camped at White Mountain, a few
feet from the river. Our "library" of
law books seemed to weigh a ton. This
was the best camping-spot yet. The
scene was pretty; it seemed a healthful
place; and water, plentiful and good, was
very near at hand. But the mosquitos
were numerous and fiercely persistent;
and before turning in, the tent was sealed
as hermetically as possible, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ensued a general and complete killing of
the insects that remained inside.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of the day following,
July 17, we felt ready to start. Even if
our boat could have held all our freight,
which weighed perhaps a ton, it was not
wise to carry it, on account of the extreme
shallowness of the stream, it being then,
according to the "sour doughs," unprecedentedly
low, due to the unusual lack of
rain. So half of the freight was intrusted
to John Dejus, a French Canadian, who,
with his partner, was "going up to Council
anyhow," and who agreed to freight
our belongings at what was a very reasonable
figure, considering the toil which
it entailed. A certain amount of unpacking
and rearranging had to be done in
order to have readily at hand cooking-utensils
and food and all the comfort that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
could be manufactured for the trip up
the rivers. The tow-line was eighty or a
hundred feet long, with small pieces of
rope branching out near the end to throw
over the shoulder and pull from, the object
being to work from the shore and
keep the boat well out in the stream, in
the deeper water. Three of us pulled,
and one sat in the stern and steered with
an oar. As a matter of fact, the fellow
who had the latter occupation had the
hardest time of it; and, as we progressed,
there was greater enthusiasm for the end
of the line than for the "steering" position,
which meant a continual jumping
out into the stream and shoving the boat
off from the shore, or backing it off a
riffle and pulling and guiding its nose out
against the swift, adverse current into
water perhaps an inch deeper, which saved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the situation. Hip rubber boots were
essential. Undoubtedly, it was hard,
exhausting work. We met others with
boats less suited to the task than ours,
apparently hopelessly stuck, pulling, hauling,
shoving, and swearing. It was frequently
necessary for some unfortunates
to unload their boats, get them over a
riffle, and then reload. Others would
"cache" part of their freight (deposit it
by the way), and struggle onward, to return
later for the remainder. At first we
got along very well pulling from the
shore, though this meant not infrequently
falling over one another when the shore
developed into a bank with uneven ground,
or delays and complications arose from
the protruding brush. However, as the
stream was very low, most of the work
was done from the dry bed. At times the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
mosquitos were very annoying; all of us
wore netting. One night, when about to
encamp, almost dead to the world, these
pests were the worst I have ever encountered;
the atmosphere was black
with them. But, on the whole, the mosquito
feature of the trip had been much
exaggerated; for, as we proceeded, the
netting was wholly dispensed with, and
at Council City, most appreciated of surprises,
these insects were not at all! It
almost took the heart out of one to see
returning prospectors or freighters in
their long, narrow skiffs, sometimes assisted
by a sail, come flying down the
stream, who, when hailed as to the condition
of the river above, invariably
shouted back that it became more difficult.
And it did become more difficult
soon after turning into the Neukluk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
River; and, furthermore, it began to
storm, so that when our tent had been
finally erected, it was a question whether
the wind would not tear out the pegs,
which had been driven into the loose
gravel of the dry river-bed, and land us
somewhere down-stream. But all that
is now an interesting reminiscence. In
spots the stream was black with salmon
and salmon-trout. We passed several
camps of the river Eskimos, who were
drying fish, fastened in clothes-pin fashion
upon an ingeniously contrived rack.
The Neukluk in places was broad and
shallow, or broken up into a number of
streams by alternate gravel bars, or occasionally
the stream broke, forming an
island, and it was a question which branch
to follow. Rain for a day added to the
complications, but it was not sufficient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
raise the stream. As our destination was
neared, the country appeared bolder, more
mountainous, and it was a pleasure to see
once in a while a little forest of spruce
on the shore of the stream. But now the
tow-line was practically abandoned, and
it was a case of hauling and shoving the
boat with hands and shoulders, one of us
frequently going on in advance to discover
a route which would afford the
necessary passage, or to kick out a channel
through the stones and gravel. It was a
wonder to me frequently that some of us
were not bowled over, tired as we were, by
the strong, swift current. Sometimes it
was too much for poor human nature to
stand, and the one would curse the other
liberally for not doing this or that, all to
be forgotten and forgiven after the inner
man had been appeased and rest obtained.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p><p>At last, late in the day of July 19, on
rounding one of the many curves of the
river, Council City, in the bright evening
sunlight, burst upon the view, the prettiest,
best sight that we had seen in Alaska.
The peculiar light seemed to magnify it,
to make it stand out very clear and distinct.
There is a sudden high plateau,
terminating abrupt and sheer at the stream
in a rocky cliff some thirty or forty feet
high, bare for the most part, but covered
here and there with a growth of moss
and shrubbery. This elevation tapers
down to the level of the stream, where
the little camp of miners marks, at the
east, the point where Melsing Creek
flows into the Neukluk, and also falls off
at the west, where the large camp or
general reservation is found, free ground
for all. Along the plateau and beyond&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sprawling, scattered collection of log
cabins, saloons, and dance-halls, with
here and there a sod house or tent&mdash;is
Council City. Back of it, to the north
and west, along the foot of a bleak mountain
which seems to shelter the camp,
is the narrow belt of invaluable timber.
The river-bed here is perhaps a hundred
yards wide, but at that time the greater
part of it was visible, the stream breaking
above and coming down in two rapid,
narrow forks touching each side of the
shore. Across the river and the bar, and
following its course, is a long stretch of
tundra reaching out for several miles to
low and barren mountains in the south
and west. In a straight line southwest,
over the tundra and mountains, it is said
to be eighty or a hundred miles to Nome.</p>

<p>In the late autumn of 1897, a number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of prospectors, on being told by a native
that there was gold in this section, set
out from Chenik. They wintered at the
present site of Council, and in the following
spring staked out what seemed to
them the best mining ground in the surrounding
country, the richer claims being
on Ophir Creek, a tributary to the Neukluk,
several miles above Council City.
This, therefore, is the pioneer mining
camp in northwestern Alaska, but known
to comparatively a few only, on account
of its inaccessibility.</p>

<p>We passed the camp at Melsing Creek,
and, exchanging salutations with the men
there, who knew how we felt, proceeded
slowly along the foot of the cliff, over
the last riffle. Then, making fast the
<i>Mush-on</i> among the other boats, we
pitched our tent near the stream on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"reservation"&mdash;there at last. This experience
from White Mountain to Council
was the hardest physical work which any
one of us had ever done or ever expects
to do. The distance from White Mountain
is generally estimated to be twenty-five
or thirty miles. Leaving there at ten
o'clock Tuesday morning, and making
good average time, we were at Council at
half-past eight Thursday evening, the
actual working time being twenty-three
hours, and the remainder being spent for
rest and meals.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<h4>THE INLAND COUNTRY&mdash;THE MINES</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropt.jpg" width="100" height="106" alt="dropt" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">his</span> place had the appearance
of a real mining camp. The
men one saw, for the most
part, looked like the genuine
article. A number said that this was <i>the</i>
country. Many were non-committal&mdash;they
were making ready their packs for
the "mush" to the auxiliary creeks above,
where they thought the richer deposits
were. All had to admit that it was an
auriferous country, that "colors" could
be found everywhere along the creeks,
but the question was, and always is, Will
it pay to work the ground? It frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
happens that one is the owner of
a mining claim which undoubtedly contains
a fortune in gold, but the unfortunate
fact remains that it will cost him
more money to get the gold from the
ground than the value of the gold which
is in it. All agreed, however, that this
looked something more like "God's country."
There was a verse going the
rounds whose sum and substance was
that the devil had to be punished, and,
therefore, had been sent to Nome.</p>

<p>We dined that evening at midnight, our
meals being somewhat irregular in those
days. On the 19th of July this definite
resting-spot had been found, and here we
would try our luck until the close of the
season. The most desirable and healthful
position seemed to be up on the cliff
where the log buildings, which denoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the heart of the "city," were situated.
It was soon learned that the place had
been surveyed, imaginary streets provided
for, and town lots duly awarded. This
fact was discovered the next day, after
we had selected a spot for encampment
and were about to level it off. Just then
we were interrupted by an individual
who held the proud position of town
recorder, who, pleasantly enough, said
that we were about to squat in the center
of a <i>street</i>, and that, although he personally
had no objection, our camping there
would establish a precedent which might
cause trouble. We shall not forget old
Pete Wilson, a Swede living in a sod
house near by, who came forward and
told us that we might camp upon his neighboring
lot until the fall, "free gratis,"
and who further said that he would trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
us not to set up a title to the ground adverse
to his. This is but one instance
of the many kind and generous acts of
which such men are capable; and it was
the beginning of a neighborly association
with this hearty old miner, who contributed
in many ways toward our agreeable
sojourn at Council City.</p>

<p>After singling out the least humpy
spot, the tundra was torn and hacked off
it until a layer of damp clay earth was
reached. This was then pretty well leveled
and ditched, in the belief that, by
giving the sun a good chance at this
surface, it would become ideally dry, a fine
place to sleep over. But, though the sun
was unusually friendly and, at times, in
the middle of the day, hot, that ground
remained as damp as ever. We realized
at last that frozen earth and ice beneath,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a barrier to the seepage, made the
trouble irremediable. Two large tents, one
made to open into the other, were used,
respectively, to sleep and to cook and eat
in, and near the side of this oblong arrangement
was erected the "office" tent.
A bunk put together and a folding cot,
picked up at Chenik, kept us off the
ground at night. It is a tribute to the
general healthful conditions of that country
that during the seven weeks we lived
there, despite the night dampness, which
seemed at first of ill omen, none of us
was afflicted with even a cold. For
warmth, comfort, and protection, a reindeer-skin
is invaluable.</p>

<p>There were perhaps two hundred persons
about Council at that time. Most
of the miners had made their camps above,
on the creeks where their claims were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
situated, to remain there during the working
season, though many trudged back
into town periodically for supplies and
what not. Of course the number of saloons,
with their dance-hall and gambling
adjuncts, was entirely disproportionate to
the population of the place, but their
proprietors were looking forward to activity
in the late fall and winter, when
mining would cease. A number of
horses and mules had been brought overland
from Nome, small fortunes in themselves.
People were continually straggling
in, and, camped as we were on the
bluff, with that last riffle into Council
almost at our feet, when a splashing
sound, intermingled with a bumping noise
against the stones and with oaths and exhortations,
was heard, one, or all in chorus,
would exclaim, "Another case of 'mush.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p><p>Very soon, and in no modest fashion,
the signs "Attorneys at Law" and "Surveyors"
were flashed upon the public.
There were two other lawyers at
Council, but no other surveyors. It became
at once necessary to examine the mining
records and learn the system, if any,
of indexing, with reference to searching
titles; and it was in this connection that
we met Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, the duly-elected
recorder for the El Dorado mining district,
which district is thirty miles square.
The wife of the agent there of one of the
large companies doing business in Alaska,
she had come with her husband to Council
a year before; had spent the long
winter there; and, commanding the respect
and admiration of the mining community,
had been elected recorder to
straighten out and keep honest records<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in the books, which hitherto had been in
the custody of some rather suspicious
predecessors. Young and good-looking,
her face was both refined and strong.
Some of Bret Harte's characters were
suggested. With great labor and intelligence
she had brought order out of
chaos, and had so indexed her books with
reference to creeks and individuals as to
render the work of the searcher comparatively
simple.</p>

<p>A few words concerning mining law
as applied to Alaska seem now appropriate.
The United States laws, which
control, permit an individual to "locate"
and hold as many tracts or parcels of
ground as he desires, each not exceeding,
however, twenty acres in area, <i>provided</i>,
first, that there be a bona-fide discovery
of gold; second, that the ground be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
properly staked or marked out; third,
that at least one hundred dollars' worth
of work be done on each claim every
year. It is further provided that the
miners may organize a district, elect
their own recorder, and make rules and
regulations which shall have the force
of law in so far as they are reasonable
and not in conflict with the federal statutes.
Many perplexing questions arise,
however. Our laws are too liberal and
loose, leaving open too wide the door
to fraud and blackmail, such as exist
galore in Alaska, and which could not
be practised under the carefully drawn
Canadian statutes. For instance, though
the law requires that a claim shall be distinctly
marked or staked, there is no provision
made as to how it shall be marked,
nor is it made obligatory that the stakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
shall be maintained. The fraud and confusion
arising from this situation are aggravated
in this barren country, where
timber is very scarce, and the original
stakes, for the most part, are made from
the inadequate scrub willow found along
the creeks.</p>

<p>Placer-mining (as contradistinguished
from quartz) consists in extracting
loose particles of gold from the alluvial
deposits in ancient river-beds.
Claims which border upon and include
sections of the present streams, greatly
reduced in size, are known as "creek"
claims, and are generally supposed
to be the richest. There is on every
creek a "discovery" claim, and all
the others upon it are known as Nos.
1, 2, 3, etc., "above" or "below Discovery,"
and are so staked and recorded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Those claims which are located farther
up the bank, and which do not embrace
the stream, are called "bench" claims,
and are known frequently by the name
of the wife or daughter of the miner, or
by any fanciful designation. It was this
latter class of claims which, up to that
time ignored or overlooked, in the middle
of the season were discovered to be
in many cases richer than the creek
claims. Many who had left the country,
disgusted and crying out against the
laws which permitted a few individuals
to take up and hold an entire creek, had
passed over this good ground without
even prospecting it. On the other hand,
more persistent miners had secured rich
claims where apparently there was no
ground to stake. The twenty-acre claim
is usually staked out in the shape of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
parallelogram 1320 feet by 660 feet. One
is likely to locate rather more than less
ground than that to which he is entitled.
Therefore, some of these canny old boys
would measure along with their tape-lines,
spell out a "fraction," and immediately
seize upon and hold it.</p>

<p>We were early impressed that there
was no "fake" about this country. It
was a continuation of the wonderful formation
which, beginning in the west back
of Port Clarence, extends eastward and
back of Nome to the Golovin Bay country.
Clients began to drop in. In many
instances they sought free advice; and,
sometimes, when the conversation had
reached the legal point, it became necessary
to instruct our callers that, if they desired
to know anything further, our consultation
fee would be exacted. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
therefore a case of pay up or move out.
For Alaska, our law library was imposing
and complete. Certainly it was the best in
Council City. The surveyors (T&mdash;&mdash;
working in as chainman) were busy.</p>

<p>We had been settled only a few days
when First Lieutenant Offley of the Seventh
United States Infantry, with thirty-odd
men from St. Michaels, trudged by our
camp, and it was good to see them. The
lieutenant had been sent to preserve law
and order and hold military court pending
the passing of the country into the hands
of the civil administration, and the arrival
at Council of the United States commissioner,
as provided by law. They camped
in their round tents near the river and beyond
the reservation, in our plain view,
whence the various bugle-calls came to us
very clearly and marked the time of day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p><p>The world is very small. It soon developed
that, after the Cuban campaign,
Lieutenant Offley and my brother, by
chance, had traveled together in the same
train from Montauk Point, in the same
seat, and the lieutenant, weak from Cuban
fever, had been assisted over the ferry
to New York by my brother. Neither
knowing the name of the other, they next
met at this jumping-off place.</p>

<p>Throughout his stay at Council the
lieutenant performed his duties with an
ability and conscientiousness which commanded
the respect of the community;
and there was much for him to do which
was both novel and perplexing&mdash;for instance,
the assumption of the judicial
r&ocirc;le. One of the things which tried him
sorely was the case of a woman physician,
who had wandered down from the Klondike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
country and squatted with her tent
on a lot which somebody else claimed.
The case was argued before the lieutenant,
and the decision went against her,
and very properly. She refused absolutely
to vacate, insisting upon being a
martyr; and, though the duty was unpleasant,
for the sake of example at least,
she was put under arrest, with generous
jail liberties. Finally she was sent down
the river with a corporal's guard to the
higher authorities at St. Michaels.</p>

<p>Within a short time we had as much
law work as we could do, and very interesting
and novel, and frequently fatiguing,
it was. In addition to drawing agreements
and deeds, it consisted of preliminary
interviews in that stately office, followed
by long and laborious walks for
many miles through the timber, up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
down mountainous hills, over tundra, and
through streams, to the mines on the
creeks beyond, there to examine stakes,
witnesses, and liars. Frequently, before
starting back, we would be invited to eat
with the men, and a fine lot they were as
a rule. Then the case had to be presented
before the lieutenant and argued,
with the assistance of mining-law quotations
and diagrams. In many instances
the lieutenant would make a personal inspection
of the property in dispute. If
one side appeared to be clearly in the
right, the other party would be ordered
off the premises; if it seemed to be an
honest contention, and there was merit on
both sides, the disputed ground would be
tied up, a dead-line drawn, and soldiers
camped there to see that neither party
mined the contested territory. Either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
party, if dissatisfied, might appeal to the
federal court then established at Nome.
But we were hearing strange tales about
that court. There was a persistent rumor
that it was only the instrument of a great
scheme to confiscate the rich mines. There
was said to be a large corporation organized
in the East, with influential political
backing, whose guiding genius, on the flimsiest
of pretexts, in violation of all the rules
of legal procedure, and virtually under no
bonds, was being repeatedly appointed by
this court receiver of these mines.</p>

<p>Through a tip from a client for whom
we had done some legal and surveying
work, my brother and I secured a fraction
of mining ground on Melsing Creek,
which was staked, surveyed, and recorded
as the "Eli Fraction." We four staked
out also an association claim of eighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
acres on a bench of Ophir Creek, which
claim is called the "Rajah," and we
secured other interests farther up on
Ophir Creek. As a favor to friends, we
would be willing to sell out our mining
interests for a million dollars cash!</p>

<p>In placer-mining the "pay dirt" (usually
found near bed-rock) is shoveled
into long, narrow boxes called "sluices,"
varying in length, at the bottom of which
are small cross-pieces of wood ("riffles"),
or copper plates, or mercury, devised to
catch the gold. The creek is diverted so
as to send a stream of water into the
"head" of the sluice-boxes, and the gold,
by virtue of its greater specific gravity,
is caught by one or several of the contrivances&mdash;the
stones, gravel, and dirt
being carried by the current out of the
boxes, and constituting the "tailings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
After a certain number of hours' "run,"
the water is temporarily diverted, and the
"clean-up" takes place; that is, the
sluice-boxes are cleaned out, and the
gold separated from the black sand and
iron substances which usually remain
with it. Water, therefore, is absolutely
essential. In 1900, at first, the general
complaint was "no water," although
later, when the heavy rains came, it was
"too much water." Placer-mining is a
delicate and uncertain business, and is
very hard work. Gold is not "picked
up" anywhere, and mother earth yields
her treasure very stubbornly. The gold
of this country consists mainly of fine
particles or "dust," and, compared with
the Klondike, but few nuggets are found.
It is, however, purer than the Klondike
gold, and assays higher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p><p>One day in August, with a large pack,
and followed by an unattractive but devoted-looking
dog, there came into Council
F&mdash;&mdash;, whom we had known on the
<i>Lane</i>. He was only twenty-two years
old, but financial stress had compelled
him to leave his university prematurely;
and he had been among the first to cross
the Chilkoot Pass and undergo the rigors
of the Klondike. Late in the season of
1899 he had come from the Klondike to
Nome, and had acquired, as he believed,
some valuable interests there, which he
had been obliged to intrust to a partner, as
he was carried out from Nome in the fall
more dead than alive with typhoid. Returning
the next year, he learned that his
partner had robbed him, and that all that
remained was this dog. So, with his pack
and his dog, and the aid of a compass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
he had walked over the mountains and
tundra from Nome to Council,&mdash;sleeping,
of course, in the open air and upon the
ground,&mdash;in quest of employment on one
of the Wild Goose properties, "No. 15
on Ophir." And he was rather a delicate-looking
fellow. He dined with us, and
we extended to him the hospitality of our
kitchen floor for the night, for which he
was very grateful. Notwithstanding his
continued ill fortune, F&mdash;&mdash; seemed to be
in first-rate spirits. He recited a verse
which he had composed, after "Break,
break, break," etc., which began thus:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Break, broke, bust, on the ruby sands of Nome,<br />
Break, broke, bust&mdash;three thousand miles from home!"<br />
</p>

<p>The way he got it off caused general
laughter. He endured for two weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
work which very few strong men can
keep up, working on the ten-hour night
shift shoveling frozen ground up and into
a sluice-box; and then, pretty well used
up, but with enough money to take him
home, he departed for Nome, this time by
way of the river, saying that he hoped to
return next spring. Certainly pluck was
not lacking in his make-up.</p>

<p>There is no game in this country to
speak of. Occasionally, however, one
would scare up a covey of ptarmigan or
white grouse, and of course there were
fish in the stream. The government recently
imported into northern Alaska
some reindeer with Laplanders to care
for them, and there are scattered reindeer-stations.
But none of these animals
were seen.</p>

<p>Very pretty wild flowers, many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
which I had never seen before, grow out
of the tundra. I have gathered as many
as ten different species within a quarter
of a mile of our camp. In places blue-berries
grew thick, and salmon-berries
were numerous.</p>

<p>Once in a while a letter of comparatively
ancient date, passed on from Nome
to some traveler, would reach us&mdash;a great
treat indeed. Toward the end of August
we learned the result of the Yale-Harvard
race, which had been rowed the end
of June. Miners would come around and
ask for the loan of a paper or novel&mdash;any
old thing would do.</p>

<p>Soon after we had become settled at
Council, with intermittent fair weather, it
rained almost daily, the rain coming up
and clearing off suddenly; and one soon
grew accustomed to the peculiarities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the climate. It was a great relief to have
the nights begin to darken. After the
middle of August they became quite
dark, and, at the same time, we not infrequently
found in the morning a layer
of thin ice in the buckets of water.</p>

<p>On August 25 T&mdash;&mdash; left us, having
received bad news from home; and September
1, to the regret of all, the military
departed, as the arrival of the commissioner
for the Council City district was
daily expected, and presumably there
would be no further need of the soldiers.
A petition, addressed to the general commanding,
seeking the retention of the
military throughout the winter, was gotten
up and freely signed, but fear of the
friction which, under such circumstances,
is likely to exist between the civil and military
authorities, rendered it of no avail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
About September 1, a heavy storm with
a driving rain set in, which continued
with no moderation until the 8th of the
month. Dams were washed away, and
mining operations ceased. It seemed at
times impossible that the tents could stand
up against the wind, or that the canvas
could longer keep out the heavy rain.
The "boulevards" of Council were in a
very sorry condition. It was very dismal
comfort those days. The Neukluk had
become a young Mississippi, and the bar
of the stream was now entirely covered.
The wind blew furiously up the stream;
and it was almost an unbelievable sight
to behold one day a freighter sailing
slowly and surely, impelled alone by the
favoring wind, <i>up</i> the stream and over
that riffle which hitherto had been the
heartbreaker.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p><p>In view of this storm and the early
approaching winter, the mining season
seemed to have ended, and we decided to
quit for Nome and home on the next favorable
day, and began to make ready
accordingly. C&mdash;&mdash; had decided that he
would spend the winter at Council, and I
determined to return in the following
spring. A very good log cabin, nearing
completion, which would answer for
C&mdash;&mdash;'s residence and the firm's office,
was leased, and the bulk of our general
outfit moved into it. It was economy for
C&mdash;&mdash; to come with us to Nome to lay
in his winter supplies. Sugar was selling
at Council for 35 cents a pound; coffee
75 cents; flour $7.50 a sack; kerosene
$1.50 a gallon, etc.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, September 9, breaking
fair and favorable, burdened with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
only a few essentials, we set out in
the <i>Mush-on</i> at half-past seven o'clock.
How different it was from coming up!
The boat seemed at times fairly to fly
along, borne by the current and assisted
by the oars. At a sudden turn we were
hailed by some freighters, and later by
the <i>Arctic Bird</i>, which, taking advantage
of the sudden rise of the streams,
was bringing up some heavy machinery.
The former handed over to us some home
letters, and a batch of mail from the latter,
well protected, was thrown at us
and picked up safely out of the river.
This mail added to the general gaiety of
the situation. At half-past twelve a short
stop was made at White Mountain to pay
our respects to friends there; and then
we pushed on, rowing more as the river
became broader and the current less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
swift. Taking the wrong fork at the
delta of Fish River, it looked for a while
as if we should be stranded on the mud-flats
and obliged to return to the proper
channel; but by getting out and pulling
the boat, which drew practically no water,
we soon were well off, wading into the
Golovin Bay. Then, with the aid of a bit
of canvas, the favorable wind, and our
oars, we reached Chenik at six o'clock in
the evening, having covered a distance in
ten and a half hours which had required
four days in the ascent. I believe that is
the record time. Fortunately, it was not
necessary to wait for means of transportation
to Nome, as the <i>Elmore</i>, a miserable
little tub, sailed from Chenik that night.
The fellow-passengers were a tough lot of
men and women; and all camped together
very informally that night on the floor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the cabin. The storm came up again.
It was very rough, and in consequence it
was a miserable, sick crowd. Having
stopped at Topkok for some additional
passengers, who came aboard with satchels
of gold-dust, the <i>Elmore</i> was off Nome
at six o'clock the following evening, bobbing
like a cork in the now fast increasing
storm. After some difficulty in
getting into it, in truly a very thrilling
fashion, we were rowed ashore in a life-boat
and artistically beached through the
surf, a feat which could be performed
only by that crew of skilful Swedes.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">ome</span> had become more substantial
in appearance,&mdash;there
were fewer tents and more
buildings,&mdash;but it was even
more unsightly now that the rain had
made the streets a perfect sea of mud,
knee-deep in most places. The Wild
Goose Company's railroad had been laid,
and was in successful operation. On all
sides was manifest the hustling genius of
the American people. We put up at a
remarkably promising place, The Golden
Gate Hotel; and, after a long unacquaintance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with such a luxury, rested
between sheets, and gave our things a
chance to dry. We were lucky to have
caught the <i>Elmore</i>, for otherwise it
would have meant detention at Chenik
for a week, awaiting an abatement of the
storm. It was a pleasure to see some of
our friends again, and very interesting to
learn the news and latest developments.
The story of the wonderful strike of gold
at Kougarok and Gold Run, back of
Port Clarence, was corroborated, and,
generally, the mine-owners said that the
country was richer than they had ever
dreamed it to be. The receivership story
was also very generally confirmed.
Undoubtedly there then existed in the
civil administration of the Nome country
as corrupt a ring of wholesale robbery
and blackmail as one can imagine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p><p>The following account may better
enable the reader to appreciate the magnificence
of the scheme of confiscation
which at this time was in a prosperous
state of realization.</p>

<p>There had been organized in the city
of New York, under the laws of Arizona,
with a capital stock of fifteen million
dollars, The Alaska Gold Mining Company,
of which Alexander McKenzie, a
man of political influence, well known in the
Dakotas, was the chief promoter and the
owner of a majority of the stock. He had
placed a portion of the remainder where
he believed it would stand him in good
stead. The main assets of this company
consisted of "jumpers'" claims to rich
mining property near Nome, principally
situated on Anvil Creek&mdash;claims which,
having already been taken or "located,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
had been "jumped" or "relocated" by
certain individuals on some of the pretexts
suggested by the looseness of our
mining laws, and which in a new country
so frequently constitute a species of legal
blackmail. These claims, for the most
part, had been purchased from the original
owners by the Wild Goose and the
Pioneer Mining companies, large corporations
which had been formed to operate
them, and other claims, on a very large
scale, and which, with immense equipment
at hand for future operations, were
already, in the early season of 1900, engaged
in taking out the gold in great
quantities.</p>

<p>In company and on the same vessel
with McKenzie, Judge Noyes arrived at
Nome on the nineteenth day of July,
1900, and (to use the language of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Circuit Court of Appeals in the McKenzie
contempt cases) "on Monday, July 23,
before the court was organized and before
the filing of any paper of any character
with the clerk of the court,
[McKenzie] was appointed by Judge
Noyes receiver of at least four of the
richest claims in the district of Nome, upon
complaints made by persons the interest
therein of at least one of whom had theretofore
been acquired by the receiver's
corporation, the Alaska Gold Mining
Company." And this, too, upon papers
grossly inadequate, without notification
to the parties in possession, or an opportunity
for them to be heard, and, generally,
in total disregard of the necessities
of the situation and legal precedent.
The orders appointing McKenzie receiver
of these claims directed him to take immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
possession thereof; to manage
and work the same; to preserve the gold
and dispose of it subject to the further
orders of the court; and expressly enjoined
the persons then in possession from
in any manner interfering with the mining
of the claims by the receiver. By a subsequent
order, and in the very teeth of
the express prohibitory provision of the
statute under which the court was created,
Judge Noyes further ordered that the
receiver take possession of, and that there
be delivered to him, all <i>personal</i> property
of every sort and description on one of
these claims and in any way appertaining
thereto. The receiver's bond in each case
was fixed at only five thousand dollars,
though at least one of these claims was
then yielding about fifteen thousand dollars
a day!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p><p>Thereupon, several of the parties thus
held up by this highway procedure, upon
proof and affidavits, moved the court to
vacate these orders, which applications
were denied, as were the petitions to the
court for the allowance of an appeal from
its orders granting the injunctions and
appointing the receiver, the court holding
that its orders were not appealable, and,
in effect, that its jurisdiction in the matter
was exclusive.</p>

<p>Upon the refusal of the court to allow
an appeal, the Wild Goose and Pioneer
Mining companies, which were represented
by able counsel, secretly despatched
to San Francisco, on a fast
vessel, a special messenger bearing papers
and affidavits disclosing the record of the
court at Nome, upon which to base application
to the appellate court, the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, for allowance of appeals
and writs of supersedeas. This writ,
which, in effect, nullifies the proceedings
of the court below pending the determination
of the appeal which it, the appellate
court, has allowed, was granted in the
Wild Goose cases by Judge Morrow, upon
the giving of proper bonds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the receiver business was
in full swing, and McKenzie became
known near and far as the "King of Receivers,"
or the "Big One." After a
while, when the thing was becoming too
notorious, the court evinced a certain delicacy
of feeling by bestowing sundry receiverships
upon selected friends of McKenzie,
instead of handing them all over
to the chief. Many mine-owners did not
attempt to develop their ground, fearful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
lest, it proving rich, the receivership
jurisdiction would be thereto extended.
Charges and countercharges of bribery
and corruption were rife, and the fight
between the attorneys for the ousted
parties and the "ring" became strenuous
and embittered.</p>

<p>In the midst of the storm above referred
to,&mdash;on the 14th of September,&mdash;an
exciting rumor spread throughout the
town that the writs from the appellate
court had arrived; and this proved to be
the fact. The Nome dailies (three of
them) came out with such head-lines as
"McKenzie Thrown out of His Job,"
"Death-blow to the New York Ring,"
and printed in full the writ commanding
a stay of operations and a return of the
property.</p>

<p>But McKenzie did not proceed to obey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the mandates of the higher court, nor did
Judge Noyes order him so to do, though
they both had been served with all the
requisite papers.</p>

<p>With the knowledge that the Circuit
Court of Appeals was back of them, the
Wild Goose people took possession of
their mines. McKenzie, acting under the
kind of legal advice that he wanted, maintained
that the writs were irregular and
void, and absolutely refused to deliver up
the gold-dust which he had mined. Judge
Noyes made an order merely staying all
proceedings in his court, and refused to
make orders compelling McKenzie to
obey the writs and deliver the gold-dust
to the appellants.</p>

<p>It became known that the receiver
would attempt to withdraw gold-dust
which had been deposited in the vaults of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the Alaska Banking and Safe Deposit
Company; and when McKenzie, in company
with one of his "friends," made the
attempt, he found himself surrounded by
a detachment of the military and a number
of the parties interested, together with
their attorneys. As he was about to walk
out of the building, an attorney stepped
forward and stopped him, causing that
remarkable person for the first time to
lose his head and nerve. It looked for
a moment as if there might be some
gun-play, but this, fortunately, was
avoided. All this happened when the
storm was at its height, the miserable
streets of the hybrid "city" knee-deep in
mud, and when, without the semblance of
a harbor, and open to the clear sweep and
fierce attack of the Arctic gale, entire
sections of the place were under water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and houses and wreckage generally drifting
about. It was an excellent background
for a dramatic incident.</p>

<p>The next step, therefore, was to proceed
against McKenzie for contempt of court.
The time was very short; for communication
with that country ceases with the
freezing of the sea, the latter part of
October, and the distance to the appellate
court and return is about seven thousand
miles. At the last moment, just before
we sailed, Samuel Knight (Yale, '87),
who, in behalf of the Wild Goose Company,
had been fighting the ring with
great aggressiveness and skill, gave me,
for his firm in San Francisco, the papers
on which to base proceedings for contempt
of court and arrest.</p>

<p>The storm and rain continued with unabated
fury. It was impossible to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
away. All the steamers had either put
to sea or sought for shelter the lee of
Sledge Island, to the northwest, and the
shore was fast becoming a scene of
wreckage indescribable. Tugs, lighters,
floating piers, and all small craft lay
tossed upon the beach. The sea was
rising higher all the time, and soon buildings
were washed away, and the front
and lower part of the town were under
water. All machinery which had rested
upon the beach was buried in the sand.
The entire sand-spit where we had first
camped was washed by the surf. Lumber
in great piles was strewn all along
the water-front, and there were general
loot and consequent drunkenness. The
saying that the "Bering Sea is the graveyard
of the Pacific" seemed verified.
Certainly it was the most destructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and long-continued storm within my
knowledge.</p>

<p>It was during this waiting period that
we quite unexpectedly ran across V&mdash;&mdash;
and R&mdash;&mdash;. They had, it seemed, gone
northwest in their boat for about thirty
miles and tried the beach, with but little
success. Then, having, as they believed,
good information as to the rich strike
which had been made at Bristol Bay,
five or six hundred miles to the south,
they had joined a party and gone thither
in the small sailing-schooner which now
lay high and dry upon the beach. Caught
by storms either way, their experiences
were of the hair-raising order, and it was
only through the great skill and coolness
of the captain and the mate that they
were there to tell the tale. Bristol Bay
had proved to be a fake, so far as gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
was concerned. But V&mdash;&mdash; said that the
streams were simply red with salmon, and
that they found many walruses dead upon
the shore, which probably, wounded by
the natives, had come there to die. He
brought to us a splendid pair of their
ivory tusks, in which I have a special
pride. Although he plainly showed the
effects of his hardships, his cheerful
spirit was unbroken, although the thought
of having to return unsuccessful, but with
hardly a fair trial, hurt his sense of pride.
We told him of the Council City country,
and it was suggested that he go back and
winter with C&mdash;&mdash;, which proposition was
quickly accepted.</p>

<p>We dined once for experiment at the
Caf&eacute; de Paris, a very clean and dainty-looking
restaurant, quite incongruous
with its surroundings. This was frequented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
by some of the French "counts,"
German "barons," and persons "representing
capital in the East," for all sorts
and conditions were to be met at this
motley Nome. Really, our general apparel
was quite out of place. The proprietor
seemed the gentleman. He said
that he came from New York, and that
his chef was from the Caf&eacute; Martin. When
we remarked that we had eaten at the
Caf&eacute; Martin, with a French gesture of
delight, he exclaimed, "Zen zere ees
nussing more to be said!" Most of the
things were very good, but we ordered
beefsteak, about which we used to talk
at Council. That portion of the menu
was very well disguised. As an Alaskan
friend of mine once remarked on a similar
occasion, it was "so tough that you
couldn't stick a fork in the gravy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p><p>On September 17 the storm finally
abated, and, after an earnest "good-by
and good luck" to C&mdash;&mdash;, my brother
and I were rowed out to the big ship
<i>Tacoma</i>. We left many behind who
would have given their eye-teeth to be
in our boots. It seemed almost too good
to be true that we should be upon that
stanch vessel, in good health, and with
the near prospect of enjoying the delights
of a home-coming. As is frequently the
case when one has been counting the days
which are to lead up to an anticipated
pleasure, a certain apprehension that some
mishap might occur to delay departure
had been felt by us during these last days
in Alaska. The <i>Tacoma</i>, which before
the Nome excitement had been engaged
in the China trade, was officered by Scotsmen
and Englishmen and manned by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Chinamen. Big and steady, with roomy
decks, she was crowded to the limit of
her passenger accommodations. Though
the majority of the passengers had been
unsuccessful, the fact of going home
made all light-hearted and good-natured.</p>

<p>One of the first persons I saw was our
Pullman porter friend, who greeted us
grinning and deferentially, though we
were still in that wholesome atmosphere
where all men meet on equal terms and
no one is better than the other until he
proves it so. He said that he had been
lucky in getting hold of a claim, and
drew from his pocket a good-sized bottle
pretty well filled with gold-dust. I
learned further that he would "railroad"
during the winter and return in the spring
to Nome, having left behind a "good
partner" whom he had so tied up that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
would be impossible to be defrauded! I
was flattered to know that on the occasion
of his getting into a "jack-pot" (some
trouble) he had hunted Nome after me
for legal advice. He had many opportunities
to get into "trouble" during the
voyage home, as he gambled all the time.</p>

<p>Another acquaintance discovered on the
ship was the little German pioneer "Captain
Cook." We found him unkempt
and disheveled, Rip Van Winkle-like,
an object of commiseration, seated where
he had been led. The old fellow was
a very sick man, with dropsy. Quite
friendless, he was unconscious of his
surroundings, and looked up in a dazed,
hopeless way when spoken to. It seemed
as if he might not return alive to that
"leetle wife in Kansas City." But later,
he was taken out upon the deck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
seated in the sun, which did him good;
for one day as I passed he recognized me
with a bright look, and inquired for my
"brudder." It is to be hoped that this
old man, who patiently had endured so
much, safely reached his home with his
gold, and received the welcome he deserved.</p>

<p>With bright, sunny weather after the
storm, the <i>Tacoma</i>, not stopping to coal
at Dutch Harbor, steamed through Unimak
Pass, and, now in the Pacific, headed
for Seattle over calm seas. Spending one
beautiful day skirting the shore of picturesque
Vancouver Island, and passing
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca into
that incomparable inland body of water,
Puget Sound, the <i>Tacoma</i> reached Seattle
on September 27, after a voyage of ten
days. Thence to San Francisco we journeyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
by rail over the majestic route
which traverses the base of Mount Shasta.</p>

<p>Immediately upon arriving in San Francisco
the papers were delivered to the
lawyers. The day following, the Circuit
Court of Appeals, with great astonishment,
learned in what respect its mandates
had been held; and, shortly afterward,
two deputy United States marshals
were despatched to Nome on one of the
last vessels sailing for that port. Thwarting
the ring by reaching Nome before
the ice had closed communication with the
outside world, they duly arrested the receiver
and brought him before the court
in San Francisco whose orders he had
deliberately defied. Knight has since
told me of his exciting night escape from
Nome in a launch, and of his being picked
up at sea by a steamer, as prearranged;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
for, fearful of the damaging evidence
which he had accumulated, the ring did
its utmost to keep him from getting
away, employing as a means to this end
the pretext "contempt of court"!</p>

<p>The trial of the contempt cases at San
Francisco was long and hard-fought by
both sides. McKenzie has had an array
of able champions at every stage of the
proceedings. Application to the United
States Supreme Court was made in his
behalf to oust the Circuit Court of Appeals
of its jurisdiction to try these cases,
but the application was denied.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day of February, 1901,
the Circuit Court of Appeals at San
Francisco filed its opinion and judgment
in these contempt cases. The long and
able opinion delivered by Judge Ross
covers the entire history of the Wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Goose litigation, and incidentally refers
to Mr. McKenzie's relations with the
Alaska Gold Mining Company. After
referring to and commenting upon the
various proceedings, which are summarized
as "this shocking record," and
disposing of the technical points raised
by the receiver's counsel, the Court say:</p>

<p>"The circumstances attending the appointment
of the receiver in these cases,
however, and his conduct after as well as
before the appointment, as shown by the
record and evidence, so far from impressing
us with the sincerity of the pretension
that his refusal to obey the writs issued
out of this court was based upon the advice
of his counsel that they were void,
satisfy us that it was intentional and deliberate,
and in furtherance of the high-handed
and grossly illegal proceedings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
initiated almost as soon as Judge Noyes
and McKenzie had set foot on Alaskan
territory at Nome, and which may be
safely said to have no parallel in the
jurisprudence of this country. And it
speaks well for the good, sober sense of
the people gathered on that remote and
barren shore that they depended solely
upon the courts for the correction of the
wrongs thus perpetrated among and
against them, which always may be depended
upon to right, sooner or later,
wrongs properly brought before them."
It is then adjudged that the receiver did
commit contempts of court, and that for
the said contempts he be imprisoned in
the county jail of the county of Alameda,
California, for the period of one year.
In conclusion, "the marshal will execute
this judgment forthwith."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p><p>In view of this deliberate adjudication
and severe arraignment by a federal
court of rank next to the highest tribunal
of the United States, and considering also
the earnest efforts made at Washington
and the demands of the Pacific coast
newspapers for the removal of the weak
and unscrupulous judge who had manifestly
served as the tool of Alexander
McKenzie, his recently dethroned receiver,
it was natural to suppose that
effective measures would at once be taken
to rectify so great an error as his appointment
had proved to be. But, strange
to say, this reasonable expectation was
not verified.</p>

<p>In the United States Senate, on the
26th of February, 1901, an attempt was
made to exonerate Messrs. McKenzie and
Noyes. Senator Hansbrough of North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Dakota characterized the former as "in
every respect an honorable and responsible
man," and read a letter which he
had received from Judge Noyes, in which
the latter elaborately declaims how honest
and upright he is and always has been.
Senator Pettigrew of South Dakota championed
McKenzie as a man of "character,"
and eulogized Noyes as "the peer of any
man who sits upon the bench in any State
or Territory in the Union." But Senator
Stewart gave the whole affair a very
thorough airing, and caused to be printed
in the "Congressional Record" the complete
history of the receivership proceedings
above set forth, together with the
opinion and judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>One of the last official acts of Attorney-General
Griggs was the preparation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
transmission of charges against Judge
Noyes, which reached their destination
in June, 1901; and as only a reply with
explanations was required, Noyes had a
lease of official life during the mining
season of 1901. His answer to the
charges preferred against him was in the
nature of a general denial, and a justification
of his conduct in every respect.</p>

<p>Despite, however, its various handicaps,
the Nome country, it is estimated, yielded
in the year 1900 between five and six million
dollars in gold&mdash;almost as much as
was paid to Russia for Alaska in 1867.</p>

<p>Thus far no well-defined quartz ledges
have been discovered, but it is not impossible
that such may yet be found. Once
on a steady basis, it will from year to
year, like the Klondike, increase its
output until, finally deprived of its only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
attraction and drained of its sole asset,
it shall again assume the dreary, uninhabited
state in which it was discovered.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jarvis estimates that, in addition
to the two thousand who wintered
there, eighteen thousand people were at
Nome in the summer of 1900. Probably
six thousand remained in the country
throughout the following winter, well
provided for, as the government at the
close of the mining season transported the
remaining needy and destitute.</p>

<p>Before communication with the outside
world closed with the freezing of the sea,
about the 1st of November, C&mdash;&mdash; got
out a letter which informed me of his safe
arrival at Council and his settling down
in the new quarters. It seems that not
enough was found of the <i>Mush-on</i> at
Chenik to make a toothpick. At a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
meeting of the "city fathers" at Council
the nomination for president of the
Town-site Organization had been extended
to C&mdash;&mdash;, which he said he had at first declined
with becoming modesty; but, finally,
under pressure, and as a "public duty,"
he had graciously yielded and been duly
elected. This news of my partner's accession
to so high a dignity rather led me
to indulge an expectation that, upon my
return, I might be received with civic
honors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE DANGERS OF BERING SEA&mdash;A
DISMAL OUTLOOK</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropt.jpg" width="100" height="106" alt="dropt" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">he</span> spring of 1901, unlike its
immediate predecessor, did
not bring forth general or
even newspaper excitement
about Nome and northwest Alaska, and
the average observer of events, even in
cities so closely in touch as San Francisco
and Seattle, might have been warranted
in concluding that the remarkable stories
of gold in this latest El Dorado were but
fairy tales, and that another bubble had
burst. But this was very far from the
truth. On the contrary, nearly as many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
vessels as the year before, and better
ones, were scheduled to sail for Nome;
more freight and horses were being
shipped thither; and in the northward
movement there was a confident and legitimate
air which signified genuine belief
in the country and ample capital to back
it up.</p>

<p>The dreadful and discouraging reports
spread during the preceding season by
quickly-returned, faint-hearted fortune-hunters
had served a useful purpose in
very largely eliminating the riffraff and
rabble which had, in great measure, contributed
to make Nome in 1900 unsavory
and unsafe. This year, as last, accommodations
on the first sailings were purchased
at a premium, or could not be
had at all. Nearly every passenger had
some tangible proposition in view, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
whether or not it proved successful, put
himself on record as a firm believer in
the wonderful hidden wealth of the country
whither he was bound.</p>

<p>Sailing from San Francisco June 1,
and stopping two days <i>en route</i> at Seattle,
the <i>St. Paul</i>, after an uneventful and satisfactory
voyage, on the 16th of the month
halted on her long way at Unalaska. I
was fortunate in sharing my narrow
cabin accommodations with two good
men&mdash;W&mdash;&mdash;, a man of the world, with
mining interests in Alaska and possessed
of a lively sense of humor; the other, a
very gentlemanly and well-educated
"knight of the green table," who begged
pardon whenever he had occasion to
enter our common quarters. When I
first visited the state-room, to appropriate,
if possible, the best places for my belongings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a bouquet of fragrant sweet-peas
thriving in the basin interrogated me as
to whether I had not made a mistake.
Later, W&mdash;&mdash; explained that one of his
friends, in the bibulous enthusiasm of
farewell amenities, on the way to the
ship had purchased this beautiful but
somewhat embarrassingly inappropriate
gift, and had thrust it upon him. It soon
adorned the saloon of the ship.</p>

<p>Of course, the <i>St. Paul</i> carried an assortment
of curious and remarkable people&mdash;not
so diversified a lot as inflicted
the <i>Lane</i> a year ago; there was a much
higher average of respectability. First
of all, it was pleasant to know that members
of the "nobility" were with us&mdash;it
gave us a "tone," so to speak. They
included a couple of very pronounced
Englishmen, a Russian count, and a trio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of Frenchmen, one of whom, an inoffensive
little fellow, monocled and dressed
to kill, was also a real live count. The
combination lived in style and moderate
hilarity in the owner's room, and were
scheduled to investigate their large mining
interests in Alaska. Then there
was a great, strapping hulk of a man,
who wore a beard, long black hair which
curled down over his coat collar, and a
benign smile; and who had a cheery word
for every one&mdash;of the type Munyon. He
was reported to be the president of a
mining company also having "large interests
in Alaska," but he was dubbed
the "Divine Healer," and was cursed out
generally. As a rule, it is a safe precaution
to steer clear of individuals who
talk about their "large mining interests
in Alaska" or who are "representing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
capital in the East." A tall, spare man,
who bore the marks of having been shot
through the cheek, was pointed out to me
as one of the veterans of Alaska, and the
one who, in the palmy days of the Nome
beach, with a simple hand-"rocker" and
two assistants, in twelve hours' work had
made the record, by taking from the ruby
sands one hundred and twenty-seven
ounces of gold, or something over a thousand
dollars' worth. This I verified later.
We had with us also "Blanche Lamonte,"
the actress, of Klondike fame,
and several other "fairies" and minor
stars who had decided to add luster to
histrionic art at Nome. It was a series
of "concerts" which brought out, as it
were, the <i>pi&egrave;ces de r&eacute;sistance</i>. These delightful
affairs&mdash;"to cheer us on our
long voyage"&mdash;were due mainly to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
efforts of a tall, angular woman with
short gray hair, who hailed from New
York, with a down-East twang, and who,
representing some newspaper, wanted a
little spice for her article. She possessed,
it was said, some musical attainments,
and had engineered a successful
entertainment the year before in so critical
a metropolis as Nome. At any rate,
she was the self-appointed "ship's favorite,"
and she <i>could</i> manage to get a good
deal of animation from a little box-organ.
Though not a nightingale, this life of the
ship would sing a few songs of her "own
composition," and playfully insist that
we "all join in the chorus"; and, on one
occasion, apropos of nothing whatever,
she announced that she was a mining
broker and would be happy to market
properties for the "boys."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p><p>I remember also two big, husky, good-looking
miners, who used to interrogate
me about getting up the streams to and
above Council City. They had a grievance
against their "disagreeable" cabin-mate.
This was a Swedish missionary;
and the complaint was made not because
he was so "damned religious," but because
he was unsociable&mdash;wouldn't
enter into the spirit of things. For instance,
when asked whether he was going
to Nome, his only reply was that his
ticket didn't read that way. Perhaps
the missionary was canny in not allowing
his room-mates too much leeway. And
there were others.</p>

<p>As we approached the now familiar
bold and bleak topography of Unalaska,
it was apparent that the rumors of late
ice in Bering Sea were well founded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
The hills and slopes bore a good deal
more snow than a year ago, and the atmosphere
was more chill. There remained
in the harbor but few vessels.
The majority of the fleet had already
forged into Bering Sea; but the <i>Jeannie</i>,
a steam-whaler, specially fitted to "buck"
the ice, was the only vessel known to
have discharged its passengers and freight
at Nome. This had been accomplished
on the ice, during the latter part of May,
two miles from the beach, the freight at
great expense having been transferred
ashore by dog-teams. We remained at
Unalaska over Sunday, and that evening
a goodly number of the ship's company
attended song services at the Jesse Lee
Home. This institution cares for and
tries to make good men and women of
the outcast and half-breed children who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
are gathered in from various Aleutian
Islands. It is a good cause, well conducted.
The poor little isolated waifs
closed the exercises by singing "God be
with You till We Meet Again," and it
was a seriously appreciative crowd who
listened and mentally echoed, "Amen."</p>

<p>Luck plays a very important part in
getting through the ice-fields. The wind
may take a sudden turn and so shift the
ice as to leave an ample channel through
which the ship, fog permitting, may safely
pass on to its destination. But the <i>St.
Paul</i>, setting out June 17 on the northward
stretch, did not meet with these
favorable conditions. She was soon literally
"up against" the ice&mdash;not great
towering bergs, but smaller ones fantastically
shaped like floating islands, or
swans, or whipped cream, for instance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
very pretty to look at, but frequently
only the frostings of large, slushy, and
dangerous cakes that lurked beneath.
Strange birds, somewhat smaller than
penguins, sitting up stiffly and absurdly
on their tails, marshaled themselves in
military rows upon the ice, and occasionally
a seal poked up its snaky and inquiring
head from beneath the still waters.
The sea was mirror-like. Sometimes,
intensified by the fog and mist
which hung about, the sun shone down
hot, as the vessel crept slowly through
the haze and maze of her uncanny surroundings.
It was a strange, weird scene,
recalling the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"
about the albatross, the fog, the
mist, and the red-hot sun. Several times
we lay to for half a day. There was
now no night. On one occasion, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the ship slowly pushed into a cake of
melting ice, the contact causing the red
paint to gush to the surface, a bright
Irishman in the steerage temporarily relieved
the monotony by shouting out,
"She bleeds at the nose."</p>

<p>And it was becoming very monotonous.
It was then June 22, and with fair conditions
we should have been at Nome
two days earlier. Passengers became
uneasy or disgusted, and many expressed
themselves to the effect that our excellent
captain didn't know his business,&mdash;that
we were lost, and would likely have to
remain thus a month more,&mdash;and they were
for "butting right through" the ice anyhow.
Some day there may be a great
disaster in Bering Sea when an iron ship
tries to force its way through the ice.
There was a close call this season. Later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in the day, however, icy and uninviting
Nunivak Island appeared close at hand,
some four hundred miles south of Nome,
and we then knew where we were. Passing
at half speed along it, at what seemed
a safe distance, suddenly there was a
bump, followed almost immediately by a
reversal of the engines, a churning of
mud and eighteen feet of water, and frantic
efforts to get off a treacherous mud-flat.
This seemed the last straw, but the
quick action of our engineer saved the
day and a very dismal prospect. It was
near this same island that the <i>Lane</i>, our
transport of last year, struck a reef on
her way "down below" (Nome lingo
for Washington, Oregon, or California)
a month later. Her captain, imagining
himself well out at sea, was booming
along in the fog at full speed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with sails up, when the vessel struck
with a mighty jar and became a total
loss. The few passengers and the crew
were all saved, as they needed only to
step off upon the shore.</p>

<p>The <i>St. Paul</i> anchored that night in
deeper water and a dense fog. During
the night fog-horns were heard in the
distance, and a series of exchanges followed
in order that the approaching vessel
might locate us. In the morning the
<i>Senator</i>, a sister ship, loomed up out of
the fog, not a hundred yards distant.
The captains held a shouting conversation,
and, instead of being a companion
in misery, we learned that the <i>Senator</i>
had already discharged passengers and
freight at Nome, and was now on her
way <i>back</i> for another load! So, indeed,
had the entire fleet, with a few exceptions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p><p>Now knowing the course, and the
wind having shifted the ice, we pushed
ahead through the fog; and in the clear
light of the afternoon of June 24 the
unforgettable scenery of Nome presented
itself, whiter on the back-lying hills and
less inviting than a year ago. Mining
men eyed it seriously; for it looked as if
the terrible winter were lingering in the
lap of spring, which meant that the (at
best) scant four months' working season
might be materially curtailed. And this
seemed the more probable when scores
of dories came out and clustered about
the ship, their idle owners offering for a
consideration to carry passengers ashore.
It was hard to realize that one was back
again at this jumping-off place of the
world, having meantime covered so great
a distance and lived in scenes so totally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
dissimilar. But it was not the same
proposition to tackle as the preceding
year&mdash;there never before was, and probably
never will be again, a thing like that;
I had now only to follow a fixed program
until some happening or condition should
modify or wholly alter it.</p>

<p>Orders were given for every one to get
ashore right away that evening; and the
lighters, towed by a small tug, were soon
carrying the passengers thither, bag and
baggage, and somewhat disgruntled. A
few of us, who believed that, in the last
analysis, those orders were a bluff to get
rid of people, remained that night unmolested
in our bunks, to visit the "golden
sands" in ample time of morning. The
waiters and stewards, too, were quitting
the ship for good or evil; for these shifty
boys&mdash;many of them pleasant harum-scarum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Englishmen, younger sons of
good families&mdash;had no idea of being
satisfied with thirty dollars a month the
remainder of their days. I wish I could
have taken down in shorthand the experiences
of "Perry,"&mdash;the way he told them,&mdash;who,
encouraged, would sit in our
state-room, when he could, and, to our
great amusement, and most entertainingly,
tell his history from the time when
he played the races a few years ago, in
"dear old England," to date. Before
departing from San Francisco he had
been dining with friends in high-life
fashion at the Palace, the swell hotel of
the city. There wasn't a more efficient
steward on the ship, and he hustled for
us in good style. How these "Atlantic
Ocean boys" sneer at the less advanced
conveniences of the Pacific!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p><p>Well, then, in the morning, seated on
a load of freight and baggage, the rest
of the passengers, in a misty rain, traversed
the intervening two miles of then
smooth water, and deposited themselves
and their hand-baggage upon the famous,
and infamous, shores of Nome. The
"golden sands" at that time were partly
covered by dead dogs and refuse, but
everything else seemed systematic and
orderly; there were, happily, no longer
evidences of great waste and confusion
such as prevailed the year before. That
the lessons of last September's storms,
however, had been unheeded was evidenced
by the shacks and frame buildings
rebuilt down upon the beach itself,
and there awaiting a like fate from
another ugly assault of the Bering Sea.
One of the signs of the times which stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
forth familiarly, and recalled scenes of
the past, was that of the "Gold Belt
Dance Hall."</p>

<p>While A&mdash;&mdash; guarded the baggage,
W&mdash;&mdash; and I went in search of a temporary
abiding-place, and decided in favor
of an unfurnished room at the Gold Hill
Hotel, situated in a less crowded part of
the town. Into this we soon placed
our folding cots, blankets, and personal
effects; and as the bar immediately underneath
us was not then doing a land-office
business, we considered ourselves
lucky to be so well settled thus soon.
The sea, fortunately, was sufficiently calm
to permit discharging the freight, which
was well cared for and put under cover
by the reliable Alaska Commercial Company,
to which we had intrusted it and
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p><p>The next object of concern, after having
delivered certain papers and seen
several of the legal lights, was to determine
whether one could then proceed
on the way to Council City, and, if so,
how; but the inevitable conclusion was
soon forced upon me that I should have
to remain as cheerfully as possible in
Nome until Golovin Bay should be clear
of ice. Several attempts had already
been made to effect an entrance there, but
without success. Assuredly it was a late
season. It was still impossible for vessels
to reach St. Michaels or Teller, the
latter being the starting-point for the
new Bluestone and Kougarok districts;
and the Nome dailies were issuing sensational
extras with large head-lines telling
that "Fifteen Hundred People" were
"Starving at the Mouth of the Yukon"&mdash;at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
St. Michaels, one hundred and fifty
miles away. Many of the neighboring
creeks were yet filled with ice and snow,
so as to allow only preliminary operations
for mining, or none at all. The prospect
was made more dismal by the stormy and
cold rainy weather which then prevailed.
The gale wrecked several small craft and
caused the remaining steamers to put
out to sea, and the thermometer ranged
at about 40&deg;. Fortunate indeed it was
that these conditions did not exist the
year before, when so many thousands of
helpless, unprepared people were deposited
upon those alluring shores. Now,
however, the numerous prophets of evil
preached the doctrine that last summer
had been an exception, and that this sort of
thing would continue throughout the open
months, which, fortunately, it did not do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p><p>At the new and well-appointed post-office
I was much impressed and pleased
to find a type-written letter from my
partner, dated at Council City the middle
of June, which told of his good
health and settlement in our new quarters.
This letter had been brought overland
before the melting snow and ice
made it unsafe or impossible to cross the
intervening streams. Previous to this,
my last letter from him, received at San
Francisco just before sailing, bore date
of February 13.</p>

<p>Nome seemed very orderly, much improved,
and more substantial in general
appearance. It had been duly incorporated
as a city. About a mile of the principal
streets had been boarded over (a
great improvement), though at that time,
in front of our hotel, the horses sank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
belly-deep in muck and mud as of yore.
The banner sign, "City Morgue," had
now assumed more modest proportions;
people who had wintered at Nome looked
strong and well; and the doctors somewhat
plaintively said that the camp had
been "disgustingly healthy." The majority
of the deaths were those of too
venturesome, or poorly equipped, travelers
or prospectors who had perished from
cold. But the average individual who
had spent the winter there had lived very
comfortably, with plenty of good things
to eat and drink, and I was informed
that the place had been very gay "socially."
Some were in fine feather,
others hopeful, and but few discouraged.</p>

<p>One of the characters then at Nome,
known and unmistakable from the Klondike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
down, was "Mother" Woods, in her
sunbonnet, abbreviated skirts, and "mukluks"
or native sealskin boots. A woman
of middle age, she had participated in
almost every gold stampede, enduring as
much as a man; and she swore like a
trooper. But in the winter she had
nursed and cared for the sick and frozen
with the greatest tenderness, it was said;
in recognition of which a voluntary contribution
had been made to enable her to
appeal a case which in the court below
had gone contrary to her mining interests.
I had, of course, heard of "Scotch
verdicts"; but during the winter months
the Nome public had coined an expression
new to me in referring to the "Scotch
whisky decisions"; and, without regard
to the possible ancestry of the learned
court, it was a lamentable fact that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Scotch had been potent in making a rye
business of justice.</p>

<p>W&mdash;&mdash; was heading for Solomon River,&mdash;about
thirty miles distant on the coast
east of Nome,&mdash;and, believing that he had
a good opportunity to reach it with some
friends on the <i>Ruth</i>, a steam-schooner, he
gladly pulled out from Nome on the 27th
of June, while we wished him the wealth
of "King Solomon's mines."</p>

<p>The days passed by; the inhospitable
weather continued; and still there was no
certainty of getting into Golovin Bay to
travel up the streams to Council City.
It was becoming a rather serious matter,
and it would have been natural for my
partner to suppose that I either had been
prevented from coming altogether or had
been indefinitely delayed by some mishap.
I had seen all the people I cared to see,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was heartily sick of the town, and the
Gold Hill Hotel, thinly partitioned and
put up on the cardboard plan, was not
running a very effective heating-plant.</p>

<p>One day there shuffled uninvited into
the room, a trifle in his cups, a miserable-looking
individual who announced that
he was "Uncle Billy" and that everybody
knew him, and then proceeded to
jabber his tale of woe. He didn't explain
how or why it had happened, but
merely whimpered that he had been "shot
to pieces" during the winter. By way
of illustration, and to prove this statement,
after pointing to one useless arm he went
down into his pocket, and pulling out a
"poke" (miner's pocket-book), emptied
from it a large-sized bullet and a considerable
piece of bone, adding, with attempted
humor, that it wasn't everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
who carried his bones about with him in
that way. It seemed that he was being
made to do menial work in the kitchen,
whereas he was really a millionaire, to
substantiate which this delightful person
again resorted to his wardrobe and drew
forth a number of crumpled and dirty
mining papers. Appearing on the scene
soon after I had finished reading in "The
Crisis" of "Uncle Billy" (General Sherman),
this pitiful result of one battle
made an impression by contrast.</p>

<p>The popular saloons and gambling-houses
were crowded, but the stakes were
low (for mining operations had not yet
begun, and "dust" was not coming into
camp), and probably half of the attendance
was due to the warmth of these
places. All the games were going&mdash;roulette,
vingt-et-un, faro, poker, stud-poker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Klondike, and craps. There was
usually a platform in the rear supporting
a piano and a phonograph, and serving
as a stage from which sirens would torture
the popular ballads, whose agony
penetrated the street.</p>

<p>I should have enjoyed attending the
sessions of the court, but the judge and
court staff were then on the high seas,
going to hold a short term at St. Michaels,
pursuant to law. In a more or less desperate
attempt to fill in the tedious waiting-time,
A&mdash;&mdash; and I one evening sought
amusement at the "Standard Theater."
The entertainment was not calculated to
delight delicate sensibilities.</p>

<p>The glorious Fourth was appropriately
celebrated by ample decoration with
the flag throughout the town and a very
creditable parade, which, headed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
company of sturdy regulars from the
neighboring military post, was followed
by an A1 fire-engine drawn by fine horses,
three uniformed hose companies, and a
score of lively little school-children.
Such are the enterprise and conquering
spirit of our people!</p>

<h4>UP THE STREAMS&mdash;AN EVENING AT
JOHNSON'S CAMP</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropb.jpg" width="100" height="106" alt="dropb" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">y</span> this time it was certain that
Golovin Bay was open. The
Klondikers and Yukoners, a
sturdy lot of earnest men and
not looking a bit starved, were pouring
into town from St. Michaels, and the
report came that ships at the northwest
were unloading at Teller and Grantley
Harbor. Nothing loath, I got away from
Nome in the evening of July 5 on the
small steamer <i>Elmore</i>, which I did not
remember with especial relish. The floor
accommodations had meantime been supplanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by bunks, and the trip to Golovin
Bay, which we reached the following
afternoon, was not half bad. Just before
anchoring, we came alongside of the <i>Ruth</i>,
which lay there absolutely helpless, her
steering-gear smashed beyond redemption.
Much surprised to see W&mdash;&mdash; on
the derelict, I reached over and shook his
hand, and then heard his little tale of woe.
When he had left Nome, nine days before,
it was too rough to land freight
at Solomon River, and, having a number
of passengers and considerable freight
aboard for Golovin Bay, the <i>Ruth</i> had
proceeded thither, only to run into the
ice, smash her rudder, and be almost capsized
by the powerful outgoing floes while
held tight in the ice. Nearly the entire
crew had promptly deserted, and only the
captain, a sulky engineer, and a few enforcedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
faithful passengers remained.
(One of the numerous little hard-luck
stories of life in the Arctic "gold-fields.")</p>

<p>It was fortunate to find at Chenik the
<i>North Star</i>, a small stern-wheeler river
boat, with whose captain a number of us
quickly made satisfactory arrangements
for immediate transportation to White
Mountain, the half-way point to Council
City. She soon, duck-like, flopped over to
the side of the <i>Elmore</i>; our freight was
rustled into her with all despatch; and,
at eight o'clock in the evening, pretty
well laden with passengers and their effects,
this gem of the ocean, under the
peculiar care of a crazy old Swede and
his motley crew of three, was puffing and
breathing hard and pushing her clumsy
way across the bay toward the hidden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
delta of the Fish River. It was a matter
of lying about the primitive machinery,
by the boilers and wood fuel, to keep
warm, and listening to a not too delightful
crowd of alleged miners swapping lies
about the country. Sleep, of course, was
out of the question; a place to stretch
out was not available except in the adjacent
bunks of the crew, and on inspection
of these I decided that I would rather not.
It would not have seemed at all natural,
or homelike, had we not proceeded, about
midnight, to run into fog and upon the
mud-flats. Only two and a half feet of
water were requisite to allow the vessel
to navigate, but in order to get that depth
it was necessary to keep strictly in a zig-zag
"channel," regarding whose location
our navigator was not precisely expert.
While we lingered upon the mucky bottom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
a section of the crew, provided with
a pole and a boat, under the orders of the
captain (expressed forcibly and picturesquely,&mdash;not
to say profanely,&mdash;<i>&agrave; la
Su&egrave;de</i>), would complete circles ahead and
about the <i>North Star</i>, shouting back, "One
foot," "Two," "Two and a half," "Three,"
according as they sounded the depths.
But we did finally, somehow, get into
the Fish River; and, after needlessly
butting the banks several times and
smashing the tender, our little steamboat
the following afternoon rested on the
shore at White Mountain, and another
transfer of freight promptly ensued.
How unpleasantly familiar one's boxes
and bags become by the time they have
reached their final destination! White
Mountain showed plainly enough, in its
wholly demolished structures and twisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
log cabins, the sweeping force of the ice-jam
and flood which had rushed down
upon it, about the middle of June, on
the breaking up of the streams. Almost
providentially, it seemed, a saloon remained
serenely intact in the very center
of the havoc.</p>

<p>So far so good, but the only way to
travel in this country is, if possible, to
shove right through somehow, and recuperate
when the ultimate goal has been
gained. Together with two others who
were making the trip to Council, I made
terms with "Ed" Trundy, a freighter, to
carry my ton and a half of stuff the remaining
twenty-five or thirty miles for
three cents a pound. His equipment for
transportation consisted of a long, shallow,
forty-five-foot boat, two river poles, an assistant,
"Louis," five dogs, and a swearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
vocabulary which was universally recognized
as being the most replete, ornate,
and frequently employed in that section
of the country&mdash;which is saying a great
deal and paying a very high compliment
to Mr. Trundy. But, then, that robust
gentleman had enjoyed and profited by
many advantages of training and environment
not shared by his less fortunate
competitors. Born in the backwoods of
Maine, he had been a lumberman, had
shipped before the mast as seaman,
driven a hack in Boston and a street-car
in New York, had freighted on the Yukon,
and it is possible that he may have driven
a mule-team in Texas. "Ed" steered the
craft, and, when the going was good,
those dogs, under the special charge of
Louis, pulled the entire load of three
tons up the swollen streams just about as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
fast as the rest of us cared to walk. We
rode when the dogs rode, that is, when
it was necessary to pole over a slough or
cross the stream. The recent freshets
and still melting snow in the hills and
mountains beyond made shallow rivers of
the streams,&mdash;in places, however, deep,&mdash;and
thus, to a large extent, obviated the
heartbreaking and back-breaking experiences
of the preceding year.</p>

<p>The plan of travel was to proceed only
a few miles that evening to a temporary
encampment where Trundy had arranged
to pick up some additional freight, and
where we should spend the night, making
an early start in the morning. Arrived
there, I imposed upon the good nature
of some agreeable fellows, lugging my
blankets into their tent and spending the
night with them, packed like sardines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
We made an early start in the forbidding
morning, our number being increased to
nine, and not a very choice company
either. It was soon apparent that the
expedition included two parties who
claimed the same mining property, toward
which they were heading with all despatch,
and that there was bad blood
between them. Suspicious looks and
whispered conversations were corroborative
evidence.</p>

<p>At two o'clock we arrived at Craft's
Road-House, near the mouth of the
Neukluk River, where a halt was made
for dinner. This was a good-sized log
cabin, with scrupulously neat interior,
kept by Mr. and Mrs. Craft, but the
Mrs. was the presiding genius. Photographs
of their restaurants at Chicago
and Dawson, and of family and friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
stiffly yet fondly grouped, adorned the
walls. And what a good dinner they
gave us&mdash;a perfect gorge for one dollar,
and cheap at five times the price!
Louis was taken ill here with cramps
in his arms and legs, due to overwork
and wetting, but only after much persuasion
consented to take off his boots and
lie down on the reindeer-skins by the
stove. While he was recuperating, the
good-natured and loquacious hostess,
seated behind (and with elbows upon) the
bar, entertained us; for Mrs. Craft, as the
name implies, knows her business and
enjoys the reputation of being a "fine
talker." Her entertainment for this occasion
was a somewhat broad and general
discussion of the marital obligations
which should exist between "squaw-men"
and their Eskimo (truly enough)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
better halves, citing her observations of
the Eskimo code of ethics and certain
instances where the informality of existing
relations had been made conventional
by voluntary appearance before a United
States commissioner and a performance
of the proper ceremonies by that officer.</p>

<p>Louis gamely enough responded, and
soon the expedition, in rain-and-wet-proof
armor of slickers and hip rubber
boots, set out to gain that night Johnson's
Camp, a couple of vacant cabins on
the Neukluk, free to all transients. High
up on the banks, extending frequently
back upon the flats, the willows and brush,
and sometimes the small spruce timber,
lay bent and crushed to the surface,
shredded and skinned, almost machine-like,
by the ice-jam which, not long before,
had roared and swept down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
streams to the bay. Old landmarks in a
new country continually presented themselves,
recalling vividly the experiences
of the summer before and the companions
who had shared them in the "mush" up
the rivers to Council&mdash;"rivers" then by
courtesy only.</p>

<p>The origin and derivation of the word
"mush" have been given heretofore, but
will bear further reference. It is perhaps
the most frequently used word in northwestern
Alaska, being universally employed
for "walk," "tramp," "travel,"
etc.; and in view of the generally prevailing
conditions of snow, rain, muck, mud, and
moss, the student of philology may find in
this expressive word a rare and precious
instance of onomatop&#339;ia. This little
digression in the narrative has not been
made chiefly for the purpose of exhibiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
familiarity with Greek, but rather as an
introduction for modestly recording a
compliment which is treasured by the narrator.
Perhaps it wasn't known that I
had been through that sort of thing before,
only more so, and perhaps, being built on a
fairly long and economical plan, I had a
peculiar advantage in that kind of travel,
but, at any rate, I felt that I had received
a very high compliment, delicately expressed,
when an old-timer in the party,
with unnecessary calls on the Almighty,
told me that I was a "musher from hell."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock at night we climbed
the steep, slippery, slimy bank to the
two cabins which constituted Johnson's
Camp, to find the one apparently inhabitable
cabin already occupied by four as
tough-looking specimens of humanity as
ever came down the Yukon. But that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
didn't make any difference, except that
they had a first lien on the soft spots of
the floor to the extent of four times six
feet by two. They had a cheerful, warm
fire cracking in the stove, the floor was
dry, and the outlook for a good rest was
excellent. But it was not thus to be.
Thirteen in the cabin taxed its capacity.
Another party who sought the same shelter,
blocked at the entrance by a full
house and a stony stare, departed. The
cooking began to mess things, and the
carelessness and profuseness of the gentlemen's
expectoration,&mdash;gently but diabolically
aggravated by the now general
leakage through a sieve-like roof,&mdash;eliminated
from my mind any intention which
I may have had of placing my blankets
and myself upon the floor. In fact, it
was difficult to locate one's self, sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
or standing, so as to avoid a trickle of
water down the neck. Here was a good
time for a bottle of whisky to get in its
work, and Louis needed a stiff drink,
for he was pretty ill. So, round it went
throughout the choice circle, and back it
came to me, empty enough.</p>

<p>Three of us decided to sit out the night
about the fire; the rest in grotesque fashion
lay stretched upon the floor. As a David
Harum sort of miner once said to me,
"The more you see of a certain class of
people, the better you love a dog"; and
about that time I felt very kindly disposed
toward the unjustly-rated lower animals.
It was generally agreed, before the turning
in began, to make a four-o'clock start
in the morning, and about the only thing
which the three of us who sat together had
in common was the intention that such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
start should be made. As we poked and
added to the fire, and dodged the drip,
the would-be sleepers showed their disapproval
of the noise and heat by moving
and muttering, and the semiconscious,
but unrivaled, Trundy rounded out a
series of epithets which left no doubt
as to his exact sentiments. One of the
figures raised itself and basted the head
of a snoring Yukoner. Louis, in his
dreamy wanderings, with unnecessary
vigor, but through force of habit, attacked
the poor dogs by references to
their maternal ancestry. One of the two
who kept me company, whom I despised
more than the other, of wizened physique
and a mean eye, fearful lest his
goods might spoil, occasionally migrated
out into the early morning light and
wet; and, slipping and sliding down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
mucky incline, mushed over to the
boat, lifted the canvas, and investigated
the quantity of water in the craft. Then,
perhaps having bailed a little, he would
climb back again to enjoy the hospitality
of the cabin and to intimate that he was
doing my work as well as his own. Having
seen his supplies go into the boat
first, and on the bottom, I could remark
that I would take the chances of having my
goods damaged. The best we could do
was to rouse the reluctant crowd at five
o'clock, and, after a delectable breakfast,
served as you snatched it, get under way
shortly after six to complete the remaining
six or seven miles to Council City.
It had not been a pleasant evening. Perhaps
the night spent on the <i>Elmore</i>, the
year before, was, on the whole, a more
disagreeable experience; but, nevertheless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the writer believes it would require
a combination of the genius of Poe and
Kipling to paint a fitting word-picture of
that sojourn at Johnson's Camp, on the
Neukluk.</p>

<p>The stream was now very high from
the rain which had just ceased. The
freighters had their hardest work ahead
of them; for the sloughs became more frequent,
the water extended well up to the
brush and spruce, and until we reached a
point a few miles below Council there was
but little footing for the dogs. The rest
of us, leaving the meanderings of the river,
struck out overland as straight as possible
for Council. I caught some of them
eying me like a hawk, and knew that
they suspected that I had a retainer from
the gentlemen with whom I had so agreeably
passed the night. Having made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
wide detour inland through mossy swamp
and brush, we came to Mystery Creek,
which was adorned in places with deep
banks of solid snow and glaciers. This
crossed, and having gained the open,
that weird, familiar landscape presented
itself&mdash;the bleak hills back of Council,
rising to the dignity of mountains, fringed
at the base with a growth of small timber,
and approached by a plain of tundra.
As Sam Dunham, in one of his matchless
Alaskan poems, with fine alliteration
says:</p>

<p class="poem">
"We traversed the toe-twisting tundra,<br />
Where reindeer root round for their feed";<br />
</p>

<p class="noin">and if there is any contrivance of mother
earth's which is calculated to sap man's
remaining energy, it is this plodding over
the Russian moss, avoiding the stagnant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
pools upon its surface, and stepping and
reaching from hassock to hassock,</p>

<p class="poem">
Sometimes as soggy as sawdust,<br />
More frequently soft as a sponge.<br />
</p>

<p class="noin">[Mr. Dunham will, I trust, pardon this
imitation of his "alliteration's artful aid."]</p>

<p>Inspired, perhaps, by the nearness of
the goal, and possibly by a desire to show
them I could do it, I then proceeded to
cut loose from the "hardy miners"; and,
not long afterward, in the cool and
sunny forenoon, stood high on the brow
of the precipitous palisades leading into
Council, which looked very attractive in
what it promised and in its own strangely
picturesque surroundings. Then followed
a hurried descent to Melsing
Creek, a fording of that little tributary,
and, now in town, a search for the edifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
which should bear the firm insignia.
There it was, my name staring me in
the face! Hastily mounting the three
steps, if you please, which led to the front
entrance of the new log cabin, I pounded
the door, heard a familiar "Come in," and
burst in upon my partner, looking as fine
as a fiddle and in the very act of laying
down the law to an unsuspecting client.
Thus then, at last, after not a few vicissitudes,
some seven thousand miles had
been traversed and the <i>au revoir</i> of the
year before realized in the present. It
had been, of course, an easier undertaking
than before, and at no time lacking in
interest; but the writer believes that, as
regards the trip from Golovin Bay to
Council City, the physical labor of the
previous year was preferable to the lack
of companionship in its successor.</p>

<h4>THE COUNCIL CITY MINING DISTRICT&mdash;JOE
RIPLEY AND OTHERS</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropo.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="dropo" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">ur</span> quarters consisted of an
excellent twenty-by-sixteen
cabin, made of whip-sawed
spruce timber, the round log
side of course being outside. Half of it,
partitioned off, was devoted to our office&mdash;a
very complete one, I may say, for
Alaska. The other half, its wainscoting
adorned with pans, pots, saws, hammers,
and the like, and its shelves and box-cupboards
holding various cooking and eating
paraphernalia, answered the purposes
of kitchen and dining-room combined. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
platform four feet wide, and stretching
across in the middle from wall to wall,
formed the base of an isosceles triangle
with the peak of the roof, and thereby
made a loft or cache, convenient for
storing provisions, etc. But, for the life
of me, I could discover no provisions for
storing ourselves at night. Immediately
in the rear of the cabin was a tent, but
that was filled with miscellaneous stuff,
and evidently was not intended for sleeping
purposes. At last the mystery was
solved in looking behind an apparently
unnecessary hanging of drill tapestry
which covered my side of the partition,
and discovering, neatly folded and caught
up against the concealed wall, an excellent
home-made bed or bunk, whose only
springs, however, were the hinges from
which it swung. Three fine, friendly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
dogs, now enjoying their summer vacation,
loafed about the back door, near a
sled upon which rested three old gold-pans
from which they fed. The cabin
was but a little distance back of our old
camping-place, the marks of which were
still very evident, and it commanded a
fine view of the tortuous river and the
landscape beyond. The appearance of
the camp had improved,&mdash;many new
cabins and several more stores had sprung
up,&mdash;but I could obtain no concrete explanation
from my partner, its president
or mayor, why, during my absence, the
city's main thoroughfare had not been
asphalted. My letters from the "outside"
telling of the time of my departure,
and those intrusted at Nome to pretended
overland travelers, all came some
time after my arrival, but I was, nevertheless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
expected to appear upon the
scene any day in early July.</p>

<p>In very short order I was again in the
traces of Alaskan harness and developing
with my partner a certain team-work in
our household duties as well as in legal
and mining matters. We were truly
"hewers of wood and drawers of water,"
and we enjoyed excellent health, although
we did our own cooking. Perhaps our
best parlor trick was what we were
pleased to term "the poetry of motion."
This took place after the mahogany had
been cleared for action, when one of us,
presiding over a pan of hot water, fished
out from under the soapy suds some
utensil and passed it along to the other,
who, accepting gracefully, gave it a
polish in transit and flourished it onward
to its allotted place. Toward the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the season a neighborly little woman, the
New England wife of a miner from
Maine, brought us some pastry which delightfully
suggested the land of the Puritans.
She sympathetically remarked that
she would have performed many similar
acts had she known we were doing our
own cooking. I must admit that we
<i>bought</i> our bread. Before I left Council
we were guests at a dinner-party given
by this hospitable neighbor, and rarely
have I enjoyed a meal more. The home
was most comfortable and roomy, and
we ate from pretty china which this little
housewife had brought all the way from
New England. This goes to show that
people can now live comfortably and well
in that remote country, if they only will.</p>

<p>The winter of course had been very
long and tedious, and, in many ways, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
most trying one; but it was surprising
to learn how lightly clad one can safely
and comfortably move about with the
thermometer ranging from 30&deg; to 60&deg;
below zero. This is due to the dryness
of the cold. For instance, at 30&deg; below,
and with no outer garments other than
flannel shirt and overalls, one would perspire
freely in chopping wood. With
hands and feet warmly protected, and
winter underwear and wind-proof outer
clothes (drill coat and ordinary overalls),
<i>and exercise</i>, one can comfortably weather
a degree of cold which, in lower latitudes,
would immediately transform him to an
icicle. The snow had averaged on the
level places about five feet in depth, but
was very deep where it had drifted and
been banked by the wind, making it a
common thing to have to dig one's self<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
out, or for a party to lend assistance in
bringing to the light, if any there was,
snow-buried men and women. The
shortest day had given three and a half
hours of dusky light; the coldest had
forced the thermometer down to 60&deg;
below zero, where kerosene had frozen.
Horses had to be killed on account of
the absence of fodder; and, after having
been left out a short time to freeze, one
would chop them up with an ax for dog-food,
the chips flying as if they were timber.
Frequent salutations on the trail
were such as, "Say, old man, your nose is
frozen," which might bring forth the rejoinder,
"So is yours"; whereupon both
would rub snow upon the senseless point,
and proceed onward. It was the continual
wind, sometimes impossible to withstand,
which worked the greatest hardship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and fiendishly got upon the nerves.
Old Tom Welch, whom I well remembered,
and his partner, while trying
to prospect in the snow, had been frozen
to death; and there had been some talk
of lynching the individual who had undertaken
to supply them with provisions,
upon whose failure to do so the two unfortunates
had essayed to return to Council
in a storm which had cost them their
lives. Some others had met a like unnecessary
fate. The natives and oldest
white inhabitants unanimously agreed
that it had been the most severe winter
known; and it was an attested fact that
many creeks in that region remained
throughout the following summer hopeless
ice and presented to the expectant
miner a frozen face.</p>

<p>The freighters came in at midnight the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
day of my arrival; and by the noon following
my twenty-odd pieces of freight
and baggage, intact, were properly stored
and distributed in and about our abode&mdash;a
very great satisfaction indeed. Those
fellows earned their three cents a pound
all right. A little later in the season two
very small and very light-draft stern-wheelers,
referred to as "coal-oil
Johnnies," plied intermittently between
White Mountain and Council, as the condition
of the streams allowed; but the
usual and best-adapted means of transportation
were long, shallow scows which
a horse pulled up-stream freighted, and
rode down upon empty.</p>

<p>This section of the country was now
the Council City Precinct and Recording
District, a subdivision of the Second
Judicial Division, as designated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Alaskan code. A United States commissioner,
with liberal jurisdiction and a
marshal at his back, supplanted our military
tribunal and the mining recorder of
the last year. With the exceptions that
his jurisdiction in civil matters is limited
to a certain amount, that he can neither
grant an injunction nor try title to real
estate, his powers, judicial and otherwise,
are plenary and varied. For instance, in
addition to his civil and extensive criminal
jurisdiction, the commissioner is <i>ex
officio</i> probate judge, coroner, notary
public, mining recorder, and tier of matrimonial
knots. In the latter capacity he
is not overburdened with work, and having
once tied, he has no authority to unloose.
There is a section of the criminal
code which in mining matters worked
very salutary results. Under it an action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of "criminal trespass" can be brought
in the commissioner's court, in which
the court may consider the record title,
and, in proper cases, oust irresponsible
"jumpers" or legal blackmailers, who
may then, if they wish, in a legal way,
seek a remedy in the District Court at
Nome. We proceeded on several occasions
under this section. If the defendant
was found guilty, he was ejected from
the premises by the marshal, and either
paid his fine and costs or languished
awhile in an unupholstered "jug." Although,
naturally enough, he was in the
country to better himself from the ground,
and not primarily from his fees, our genial
commissioner presided over his court with
dignity, fairness, and ability. I always
made it a point to wear a necktie in
appearing before his Honor. After a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
trial he might drop into our cabin; and,
over a cigar and a little Scotch whisky,
we would suggest wherein, in our opinion,
he had erred in his rulings or decisions, to
which presumptuous insinuations he would
either good-naturedly assent or demur.</p>

<p>There was a lot doing. The District
Court, though not appointing receivers,
was grinding out injunctions, or temporary
restraining orders, which, frequently
conveyed by some legal luminary, came
drifting over from Nome, and, in consequence,
some poor devil or arrant rascal
was thrown out of his job and summoned
to appear at the metropolis. There was
a pause, however, about the middle of
August, when Judge Noyes pulled up
stakes and sailed for the "outside" to
prepare himself for his October ordeal
before the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p><p>Not long after my arrival, a good fellow
named Joe Brennan, while bringing
his horses and freight up the rivers, was
drowned some ten miles below Council.
It was believed that he was swimming a
horse, and that when the animal climbed
the bank, Brennan fell off and, his boots
filling, drowned. When the body was
recovered, a few days later, it was brought
to Council, a coroner's inquest held,
and then decently buried. Northwestern
Alaska furnishes excellent graveyards,
rivaling the art of ancient Egypt. Its
ground will preserve a man forever, but
it is a long way for his friends and relatives
to come to see him. A small
amount of currency was found on Brennan;
a poke of dust with which he
was to execute certain commissions was
identified and returned to its owner; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
a considerable sum of money of his own,
with which he was known to have left
Nome, was missing. Doubtless the body
had been robbed. But there are lots of
good men in Alaska, although in the
Nome country they seem to be pretty well
scattered. Brennan's two partners, who
came to consult us about the estate of
the deceased, were such men&mdash;manly fellows
who wanted to have "poor Joe's"
property rights preserved. One of them
came from Washington, my native city,
with whom I could chat about familiar
landmarks; the other, who looked the
athlete, had held the New England
championship for the high jump, and had
trained for that event several college men
of my acquaintance. It is a well-worn
phrase, but the world <i>is</i> very small. The
Washingtonian was duly appointed special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
administrator, and soon realized funds on
a sale of the horses, feed, provisions, etc.,
which were well within the legal definition
of "perishable property."</p>

<p>Enjoying the proud distinction of being
notaries public for Alaska, and being
therefore quasi-judicial officers, we were
frequently called upon to take acknowledgments,
affidavits, and depositions. I
am not likely to forget the work of taking
an affidavit from one Joe Ripley.
It was of immediate importance in litigation
at Nome, and Ripley, a squaw-man,
who lived with his Eskimo wife
and children a number of miles down the
stream, had been specially engaged to
come up and make affidavit to certain
matters with which he alone was familiar.
As luck would have it, my partner, who
was acquainted with Ripley, had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
called away to euphonious Puckmummy
Creek (Eskimo, "quick"), and it devolved
upon me to take the affidavit.
Ripley and whisky, I was informed,
were always associated together,&mdash;were
almost synonymous terms,&mdash;and whenever
"Joe" struck town it was a gala
day for the saloons. In abnormal condition,
Mr. Ripley was a mild-mannered,
polite, well-educated son of old England.
But my hopes that he might appear in the
latter condition were blasted when, in response
to a shuffling and a bang at the
door, I welcomed in a small man with
white mustache, wearing the native coat
or "parkie," and gloriously, triumphantly
<i>full</i>! There was no doubt that this was
Ripley&mdash;recipient of the Victoria cross
for gallantry in India, sailor, miner,
squaw-man, and devotee of the bottle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"Where's Castle?" was his opening remark,
of course not knowing me from
Adam; and, as I explained my presence,
I racked my brain for delicate, unoffending
language which should suggest that
he sleep "it" off and call again on the
morrow. The suggestion of delay brought
forth a flow of noble sentiments, delivered
in heroic attitude, accompanied by gestures
dramatic. Pointing down the river,
he burst forth in glowing language on
the subject of the devoted spouse whom
he longed to see, somewhat inconsistently
declaiming, however, that the lady was
twice as big as he and usually shook the
life out of him whenever he tacked home
with several sheets in the wind. I eagerly
seized upon this latter tribute to his
charmer's charms as an argument for his
remaining over, but realized that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
useless to argue when, with emphatic
"No, no's", and a beating of his breast,
he exclaimed: "Old Joe has a very small
heart for white people, but" (stretching
forth his arms in yearning affection toward
the beloved) "his heart goes out
to <i>her</i> like a bullock's." This was all very
romantic and entertaining, but that affidavit
had to be obtained, and Captain
John Smith, somehow, had to be prevented
from escaping to his Pocahontas.
Excusing myself with the explanation
that I would consult my client in the
matter, I went on a still hunt for the man
who might manage Ripley, and the latter,
navigating his way toward the nearest
saloon, went on a hunt for the still.
I found my man, explained the situation,
and instructed him, if impossible to detain
Ripley, to steer him back to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
office, where we should proceed with the
ceremonies. Captain John having previously,
when sober, told our client the
facts to which he could swear, I purposed
having these facts act as a check
to a too willing or imaginative affiant.
Shortly afterward, I heard the two men
coming, cleared the deck for action, and
braced myself for a delectable situation.
It was a story of a "snow" location of
mining property. The law requires that
a certain fixed amount of work or expenditure
shall be done or made annually
upon every mining location for purposes
of benefiting and developing the claim,
and further provides that upon failure to
do such "assessment work" the ground
shall become open and relocatable on the
1st of January following. Hence many
individuals single out what they believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
to be valuable property, and acutely investigate
the validity of its holder's title,
nosing about the ground or searching
through the records to ascertain, first,
whether the work has been done; second,
whether an affidavit of labor has been recorded;
and, third, if the facts render
such an affidavit of no effect (save only
as <i>prima facie</i> evidence) and subject the
affiant to a charge of perjury.</p>

<p>The legal requirements had not been
fulfilled regarding the property in question;
and on December 31, 1899, Ripley
and Welch (before mentioned) set out
from Council, over the snow, for Crooked
Creek, fifteen miles away. Before starting,
they took the precaution to set their
watches by the recorder's chronometer, for
timepieces are very contradictory in Alaska,
and it frequently happens that a number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of relocators assemble at the same spot,
watches in hand, near midnight of a December
31, prepared to drive down their
stakes at the first moment of the new year,
and of course it becomes a nice question
of evidence as to who has the right time.
The case in point certainly had not been
lacking in dramatic incident. Welch and
Ripley found others on the ground for
whom no love was lost. It was not a
trysting-place. Some underhand work
was done, and Ripley, so he said, restrained
old Tom from putting a bullet
into a certain miscreant. But it was hard
work to confine the enthusiastic Ripley
to the material matters, and I had frequently
to nail him down and shut him
up until I wrote out a portion of the statement
desired. He was acting it through,
walking up and down, gesticulating, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
occasionally, falling into the native dialect.
His favorite mode of brushing aside
a suggestion&mdash;treating it as immaterial&mdash;was
to exclaim: "That's all right,
but it don't buy whisky"; and now and
then he would suddenly turn upon the
third man with the question, "Ain't she
pretty?"&mdash;referring to his Pocahontas.
Now, of all the hideously ugly creatures
rated as human beings, the full-blooded
Eskimo woman is easily the prize-winner,
and Mrs. Ripley, besides, was notoriously
unattractive even in her own class.
It was, therefore, a very embarrassing
question. My sense of professional dignity
was continually outraged, but, in the
end, I got a satisfactory affidavit, though
it required nearly four hours to round it
up. <i>In vino veritas.</i> Exit Ripley.</p>

<p>A word as to the natives of northwestern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Alaska. I presume they as nearly
approach living in a state of nature as
any beings on the face of the earth. Of
undoubted Mongolian origin, their ancestors
drifted over from Siberia to an
equally hard country where the sole occupation
of their descendants is a hand-to-mouth
struggle for existence, in obtaining
for daily subsistence the scant
provender which nature supplies ready-made.
It is a matter simply of catching
fish in their nets during the summer, and
in winter trapping the ptarmigan or wild
grouse and hunting the walrus and the
seal. Their boats, or "kyaks," made
from walrus-hide and repaired with ivory,
are very ingeniously contrived and cleverly
managed. They are naturally a
very peaceful people, except when, in violation
of the law, the white man sells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
them whisky. They are godless and
have no religion whatever, nor any form
of worship, nor any imagery, nor any idea
of a happy hunting-ground hereafter.
They bury their dead in airy wooden
biers several feet above the ground, together
with pots and pans, food, guns
and ammunition, their theory being that
the deceased has lain down for a long
sleep. Perhaps he may wake up sometime,
and then he will need the means to
procure and prepare food; and from his
position he can see his family and friends
when they come by, and note their prosperity
as represented by the number of
children and dogs. As a race, they are
few and scattered, without attempt to
live in tribal relation. The epidemics
among them in 1900 of pneumonia and
measles carried away perhaps half their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
number, and it is safe to predict that
within a short period this hapless race
will become extinct.</p>

<p>Later in July there came a welcome
spell of hot weather, which melted the
remaining snow upon the slopes and
helped matters generally, giving one an
opportunity, among other things, to sun
his blankets. It not only did great work
in thawing the ground, but it magnificently
and quite unnecessarily thawed
out the mosquitos. The latter, however,
though bothersome at times and in places,
were not very annoying. This hot wave,
which practically prevented traveling
during the middle of the day, gave way
to cooler, overcast weather, which now
and then furnished a series of rainy, disagreeable
days, broken, perhaps, by one
or two hopefully clear and beautiful. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
is the most fickle climate in the world,
and will frequently, within a few hours,
fancifully exhibit all its contrary elements
of rain and sunshine, wind and chill.
But, rain or shine, day and night, mining
operations progress, and the fine treasure
in the earth is laboriously brought to
light.</p>

<p>It frequently became necessary for one
of us to journey through the now more
sparse timber, up the slaty, moss-covered,
mountainous "divide," and over to the
claims on the fast-becoming-famous Ophir
Creek. In the absence of rain, and with
the encouragement of the wind or a little
sunshine, the ground, up to a certain point,
dries remarkably soon, and furnishes fairly
good footing. If the day be pleasant, the
cheerful chirp of the inevitable song-sparrow
and the song of the wild canary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
are heard; a thrush or robin, surprised
and alarmed, starts from the brush;
swallows and snow-white gulls from the
sea circle over and about the streams;
and odd, unfamiliar little birds hop about
in the willows. How they get there, the
Lord only knows. Beautiful&mdash;the daintiest&mdash;wild
flowers in great variety also
do their part to make a desolate country
lovely. Truly, it is a wonderful land of
contradictions. Looking down from the
"divide" to the basin below, Ophir Creek,
almost a river, is now dotted with permanent
camps along its lengthy, sinuous
course; the little log-cabin settlements,
whose lumber has been brought there at
great labor and expense, representing the
larger operators or the companies.</p>

<p>Of course, Frank Shaw was still in
charge of the Wild Goose Company's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
interests on claim No. 15 Ophir; and he
had under him about a hundred good
men, opening up the claim, shoveling
the pay dirt into five strings of sluice-boxes,
and some of them, teamsters, carpenters,
etc., daily bringing supplies from
Council over the primitive roads, or doing
other necessary work about the camp. A
very remarkable young man is Shaw, and
a very fine fellow. Born and bred, so to
speak, in the mines of California and
Arizona, and having a genius for the
work, he was naturally a "born miner,"
and, though only twenty-three years of
age, was generally acknowledged to be
the best in the Council City country. In
a comparatively recent explosion in a
quartz-mine, Shaw had been almost blown
to pieces; and although he still carried in
his face and body bits of the rock, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
could see only through powerful glasses,
he was, nevertheless, noted for his energetic
zeal and indefatigable labor. The
qualities which go to make a good miner
are, perhaps, generally underestimated.
He must, primarily, be a man of intelligence.
He must have the eye of an engineer
for turning a creek, constructing
ditches, building dams, and meeting the
exigencies of the situation. He must
know formation,&mdash;understand geology,&mdash;in
order to locate the pay streak and operate
it successfully. And he must know
how to manage men. These qualities
Shaw combined. For instance: The labor
is divided into two ten-hour shifts, the
day shift and the night shift, and not infrequently
hardy men either have not the
physique to endure the exhausting labor
of pick and shovel or they "soldier" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
their work. Men discharged for either
of these reasons usually came to Shaw
and, shaking his hand, acknowledged the
corn, and asked him to look them up if
he ever came to Montana, or wherever
they lived.</p>

<p>I noted some familiar faces in the
pits, among them those of the lusty
men on the <i>St. Paul</i> with the uncongenial
room-mate. On the steamer they
had shown me with pride a skiff-shaped
boat which they had had built in San
Francisco especially for the Fish and
Neukluk rivers; and I didn't then have
the heart to tell them that they could not
have obtained a boat more ill adapted to
their purposes. They arrived at Council
worn out, disgusted, and with only half
the load with which they had started.
And, having been told that their claim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
ten miles above, was glaciered, without
further ado or any idea of investigating
it themselves, they sold out their remaining
outfit, and went to work on "15" for
wages. In this they showed much more
stuff than the fellows who "lie down"
immediately; and, having enough to get
out on, go home and tell their friends
that the country is a "fake." Many of
these latter are the men who, on the way
up, have fiercely declaimed to admiring
audiences: "By God, sir, if I find any
jumper on my claim, I've a six-shooter,"
etc. One of these brave boys, whom
the ladies of the <i>St. Paul</i> had greatly
admired, <i>did</i> find an interloper diligently
working his Ophir Creek claim, whereupon
he proceeded to auction off his plant and
sneak out of town without so much as
making me a social call.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p><p>They were cleaning up one string of
sluice-boxes the first time I went to
"15"; the water-gate in the ditch, into
which a portion of the creek had been
diverted, allowed only a gentle stream to
flow through the huge boa-constrictor
hose into the boxes and down over the
riffles where the bronze-colored gold
shone forth distinctly. The work of the
day shift had ceased; the men were at
dinner; and Shaw and one of the shift
bosses were carefully sweeping the result
of a day's "run" into a gold-pan. This
finished, I accompanied him and his burden
to the little cabin which he and the
bookkeeper occupied; and there found
Billy West, looking sturdier after his
winter sojourn in Alaska, and engaged in
"blowing out" a pan of gold-dust&mdash;that
is, eliminating the fine black sand. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
reply to my query, he said that they tried
to average five thousand dollars every
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Old Jim, the excellent darky cook,
gave me a cordial reception, which was
even more effusive when I gave him a
cigar. He chuckled when I asked him if
he missed Mr. Sunnyside, his assistant of
last season. I think that the way Jim
expressed his feelings toward Sunnyside
is worth recording. Sunnyside was a big,
strapping Californian who had come up
on the <i>Lane</i> the year before, by profession
a lawyer, and doubtless regarded by the
fond inhabitants of his native town as a
future Daniel Webster. He aired a deep
bass voice on the ship, and presented a
very noble and manly figure as he held
up his end of the quartet. As already
observed, on the arrival of the fortune-hunters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
at Nome in 1900 there were no
loose nuggets lying about waiting to be
picked up, and, consequently, many of
the confident newcomers were obliged to
"come right down to hard-pan." And
so it happened that Sunnyside abandoned
the idea of practising law, and, later in
the season, found himself assistant-general-utility
man to old Jim at 15 Ophir.
He soon developed into probably the
most mournful, cheerless, pessimistic individual
in the country, and gave vent to
his feelings accordingly. The country
was "God-forsaken" (as indeed it is);
he suffered from several complaints on
account of the miserable climate and the
lack of a feather bed; and the days until
his escape in the autumn seemed each one
of a year's duration. One day, at dinner-time,
when Sunnyside had sounded some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
dismal note, old Jim, good-naturedly
enough, turned to him, and said: "Mr.
Sunnyside, my feelings to'a'd you am very
well expressed by the col'ed gen'leman
who was divo'ced from his wife. Says
he, 'Em'line, if I nebber see you again
dat won't be any too <i>soon</i>.'" A roar of
delighted appreciation went up from the
double row of tables.</p>

<p>The roughing and hardships of the
California forty-niners, who, bountifully
supplied by nature on all sides, needed
no cover at night other than the canopy
of heaven, and who could work twelve
months in the year, seem trifling compared
with the conditions which the Alaska
pioneers have confronted in a land disconsolately
barren and inhospitable, that
metes out a meager four-months season
for their labor. To borrow again from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Dunham, here were globe-travelers, men
who had "panned from Peru to Point
Barrow," now in August "cross-cutting
a cussed cold creek," who would say,
"There's no use telling the people at
home about this country; they'd think
you were lying." And so, in fact, it is
a very difficult thing to undertake to do;
for the reader or listener has really nothing
relative to go by, and, of course,
<i>atmosphere</i> is essential to an adequate
appreciation and understanding.</p>

<p>The ultimate yield of the "gold of
Ophir" Creek will be enormous and astonishing,
justifying its right to a name
famous from ancient times. But, as is
generally true of northwestern Alaska,
the claims in order to pay well must be
(and they will be) owned and worked
by large companies, able to incur a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
preliminary expense to mine
them properly and on a large scale.
Now and then the individual will find a
rich spot from which he and his partners
may realize a few thousand dollars; but
the palmy days of the Nome beach and
the Topkok diggings are seemingly over,
and, as most of the miners say, it is not a
"poor man's country." And yet, as regards
its wealth, hardly the surface has
been scratched. Dredging companies
have been formed to operate the gravel
bars and the gold deposits in the beds of
the streams; and there is excellent reason
for believing that fortunes will be
made in this way. An excellent indication
of the stability and extent of the
Council City District is the fact that the
common currency is gold-dust. Every
store and office has its gold-scales, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
one must, for his own protection, be
skilled in manipulating the delicate balances.
Although an ounce of "clean"
gold will average at the assayer's from
eighteen to nineteen dollars, sixteen dollars
is, in Alaska, the accepted current
value. With this, therefore, as a standard,&mdash;a
pennyweight being eighty cents
and a grain three and a third cents,&mdash;with
accurate scales and proper weights,
exchange is not a difficult matter.</p>

<p>Alaska has furnished a fertile field for
unscrupulous schemers to enrich themselves
at the expense of credulous investors.
Hundreds of claims, which
either did not exist or were not worth
the paper upon which they were presented,
have been sold to the gullible
public, and corporations have been formed
to make their stockholders quickly millionaires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Such a proposed donor of
wealth was "The Polar Bear Mining
Company," whose prospectus I had read
and whose operations near Council were
within my ken. This bonanza concern
had a capital stock of one million shares,
offered for sale at four cents a share,
and its assets consisted of forty-seven
wildcat claims upon which the prospectus
dwelt at length in golden praise, declaring
that "pay streaks" and "old channels"
pervaded the entire bunch. "Alaska
has made many millionaires&mdash;why not
be one?" was the tenor of this masterpiece
of seductive argument. After the
season was well under way, the Polar
Bear began to tear open the ground not
far from Council; and soon afterward a
party of some six or seven discouraged,
disgusted, and disgruntled men trudged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
laboriously over the tundra, and camped
near us, until they should learn from
headquarters at Nome which other one
of the forty-seven claims should similarly
be drained of its treasure. But no word
came, and there they remained abjectly
despondent as the dreary days dragged
by. One evening my partner and I
strolled over to where they were gathered
in dismal silence about a small fire,
engaged in brushing away the mosquitos,
and looking generally miserable.
They appeared to be farmers masquerading
as miners. There had been defection
in the camp, due to a controversy as
to who was the "captain," and in consequence
the circle was depleted. Speaking
of this lamentable fact, one of them,
who resembled a shoemaker out of employment,
said apologetically (but he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
proud of it): "Now, I don't want to
seem to be stuck up or conceited, but <i>I'm</i>
the boss here&mdash;I'm the <i>secretary</i> of the
company." "How much did it cost
you?" we queried. "Well," he said, "I
didn't pay anything to be secretary, but
I put twenty-one hundred dollars in the
company." At this of course we roared,
and soon had the outfit, despite their
misery, laughing themselves while we
recited choice bits from the glowing prospectus.
Before departing, the "secretary"
earnestly besought us not to tell
anybody about his investment, and resignedly
admitted that the laugh was on him.</p>

<p>Later, in August and during the first
part of September, the nights were clear
and bright and cold. A beautiful full
moon, dominant in the brilliant starry
heavens, almost made day of night, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
added luster and weird charm to the picturesque
meanderings of the river. The
north star was viewed at closer range, and
shone sparkling more nearly overhead.
Icicles, as long as one's arm, formed in
stalactite fashion, hung from the sluice-boxes
in the small hours of the morning;
but, nevertheless, aided by the light of
lanterns, the work of mining went on as
regularly as clockwork. The days were
mild and sunny,&mdash;like October in New
England,&mdash;and there was promise of a
late working autumn, though the wild
geese and sand-hill cranes with hoarse
cry were flying southward.</p>

<p>One fine Sunday morning I said farewell
to my friends at Council, several of
whom requested me to think of them
when I was "dining at the Waldorf";
and as my partner had decided again to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
winter it through and hold things down,
I left behind me a courageous, cultured,
and able gentleman, whose good judgment
and varied mental attainments the
community, appreciative as heretofore,
would enjoy throughout the white silence.</p>

<h4>THE OPERETTA AT DEXTER'S&mdash;NOME
CITY OF TO-DAY</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropc.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="dropc" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">arried</span> down the rivers to
White Mountain with Tom
Muckle, the freighter, the
horse having a free ride and
nibbling at the brush when the eddies
drew the scow to the banks, I spent the
night at that intermediate point; and, in
the morning, in a "coal-oil Johnny,"
proceeded on my way to Golovin Bay.
This last-named means of transportation
was a very ridiculous affair, but was
strictly a "get-there" contrivance. It
was a narrow skiff, about twenty feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
long, into which an antiquated gasolene-engine
had been placed, which caused the
little pair of patched-up paddle-wheels to
beat the water with a great deal of vehemence
and send the open skimming-dish
over the water at a delightfully progressive
rate of speed. The captain, engineer,
and crew consisted of a grizzled anatomy
bearing the densest growth of underbrush
in the way of beard, whiskers, and general
facial hirsuteness that the writer has
ever gazed upon. It had the nose of a
human being, which bore the signs of
conflict with the elements, and brilliantly
registered a long course of fiery internal
applications. But he was a nice old fellow,
who wanted to get back to his home
in southeastern Alaska, and envied me
my departure. Arrived at Chenik, I put
up at Dexter's Hotel, a pretentious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
comfortable structure recently erected by
that pioneer of northwestern Alaska.</p>

<p>At dinner, doubtless in order to make
me feel "at home," I was engaged in
conversation by a stout female person
rather pretentiously attired, who proved
to be the housekeeper of the hotel. At
least forty-five summers had added successive
weight to her proportions, and
the only delicate thing about her was
her sensibility&mdash;and this I knew because,
in effect, she told me so. It was so trying
for a woman to be alone in Alaska,
and how astonished her people at home
would be to see what she had to put up
with&mdash;one who had been reared, so to
speak, in the lap of luxury. It made her
homesick to hear that I was heading for
New York, whose gay metropolitan life,
I somehow felt I was to infer, she had enjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
in days gone by. This engaging
creature, in a softly modulated voice,
quite impressively selected her words,&mdash;the
longer the better,&mdash;and the fact that
they were not always appropriate to the
thought was absolutely immaterial so long
as the sentences were rounded and sonorous.
For instance, in speaking of the
ability of the commissioner at Chenik,
judging from her association with lawyers
(and she had always known the very best),
she hardly believed that he possessed a
"judiciary" mind. In reply to her leads,
I said that I had just come from Council,
and that I was an attorney; but, in answer
to her query whether I had made my
"stake," with great discretion I forbore
to boast of the fortune secreted about my
person, remarking that in Alaska one
employed his profession as an opening-wedge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
for mining interests, and that as
yet my mines were in a state of development.
This elicited the information that
she felt similarly as to <i>her</i> profession; and
when I made bold to inquire what that
profession might be, I was slightly staggered
by the rejoinder, "The operetta."
Now, if she had said <i>opera</i>, it wouldn't
have been so bad, for one associates with
the opera something grand, massive, and
substantial; but she didn't fit in with
"operetta" at all. It was a rude shock,
later in the evening, when I saw "Little
Casino" standing by the bar and drinking
her whisky straight. Then I felt
sure that the dear ones at home would
have been sorrowfully, painfully astonished
thus to see their little one, whom,
perhaps, they fondly imagined softening
and delighting with song and merriment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the rugged natures of the rough
miners.</p>

<p>It would have been asking too much of
Alaskan weather to be allowed to journey
on as far as Nome without some setback.
This was soon apparent when a storm of
wind and rain came up which held me at
Chenik for three long and dismal days.
It blew as it can blow only in Alaska.
The wind literally drove nearly all the
water out of the shallow bay, so that one
morning the unusual sight of a beach and
bar extending almost across to the other
side presented itself. I very vividly
recall one evening at that forlorn place,
when the renowned Dexter himself and a
crowd of satellites and bar-room loafers
were gathered about the table playing a
game of "freeze-out" poker. Business
was slack, and the urbane bartender,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
whom the favored addressed as "Eddie,"
and who, arrayed in a pink-and-white
sweater, was wont to flourish behind the
bar, admiring himself in the glass and
brushing his slick hair between drinks, was
one of the select party. It was a terrible
night outside. The men, now and then
during a pause, would voluntarily remark,
or interrogate one another, as to where
they'd like to be,&mdash;in what city, restaurant,
or theater,&mdash;or (one fellow in particular,
and for my special benefit) would
predict that the storm was likely to continue
for a week or more. The howl of the
wind, which the Malemute dogs tried to
rival, suddenly found another competitor,
which, dirge-like, a whooping sort of wail,
accompanied by the moans and groans of
a pedal organ in agony, was traced to the
story above. It was the "operetta" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
action&mdash;perhaps thinking of home. At
any rate, she felt badly; and the crowd
showed its sympathy by a raising of
voices and yowling like the dogs outside,
and wondering what she had eaten for
dinner to cause such evidences of pain
and suffering.</p>

<p>On the <i>Elmore</i>, which still had a monopoly
of the traffic, I reached Nome at
last, and repaired to the Golden Gate
Hotel, which, razed to the ground by
fire during the winter, had risen ph&#339;nix-like
from the ashes, a credit in structure
and appointment to almost any community.
With its boarded streets, excellent
water-supply, cold-storage plants, fire-engine
department, long-distance telephones,
railroad to the Anvil Creek
mines, and projected electric-light system,
Nome has indeed become a city. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
a matter of fact, the social atmosphere of
Nome now demands a white collar and a
shoe-shine. Wonderful when one thinks
of its geographical situation, almost in
the Bering Strait, three thousand miles
from any port of supply, scarcely one hundred
and fifty from Siberia, in a cheerless,
Arctic country, barren of everything
save gold! When the telegraph line
from the Klondike to St. Michaels is finished,
the cable, which has already been
laid, will carry it through the remaining
one hundred and fifty miles, and Nome
will then daily, in all seasons, be in touch
with the outside world.</p>

<p>I met Captain Baldwin, a prominent
and useful citizen, who was selecting
characteristic photographs to put in an
album, as a gift to President McKinley
from the citizens of Nome. And this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was on the day of the President's death.
The terrible news of the assassination I
did not learn until I reached Port Townsend,
in Puget Sound, September 26,
when the hollow shout of the news-vender,
"McKinley dead and buried," considerably
lessened the pleasure of home-coming.
The mayor of Nome had
recently made a trip to Canton in advocacy
of the removal of Judge Noyes,
and the President's questions as to how
the people of the Nome region lived had
suggested the appropriateness of the intended
gift.</p>

<p>The mines near Nome had been and
were "showing up" well. Old channels
were being discovered, and it was generally
admitted that more gold was in
sight than ever before. There had recently
been found on Anvil Creek the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
largest nugget which Alaska had yet
produced. This was on exhibition; and
I elbowed my way through the camera
fiends to heft the boulder-like mass,
which weighed ninety-seven ounces, or a
little over eight pounds (troy), and was
worth $1552. I have been informed that
another nugget, slightly larger, was discovered
in the same vicinity soon afterward.
It is not improbable that, when
the creeks shall have been worked out
by the present methods of sluicing, quite
as much additional wealth will be accumulated
from the debris by hydraulic
operations. The great richness of the
country lies in the "benches,"&mdash;creek
flats and hillsides,&mdash;and to operate them
successfully great ditches are being constructed.
For instance, on Ophir Creek
the Wild Goose Company now has under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
way a ditch, paralleling the creek, twelve
miles long and twelve feet wide, which
eventually will extend twelve miles further,
to the mouth of the stream. It was
surprising to see a number of engines
and plants of various kinds operating the
beach, which gave the lie to the general
belief that the sands had been wholly
exhausted. Despite the severe handicap
of a late spring, the mining season averaged
well, and the output of the yellow
metal probably equaled that of the year
previous. The reports concerning the
new Kougarok and Bluestone districts,
which had been heralded as "wonders"
and attracted thousands, of course proved
to be exaggerated, and caused great disappointment,
although they are known to
contain a few rich creeks and may some
day be worked on a large scale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p><p>I ran across several of the "nobility"
and also the "Divine Healer." The
former appeared less chipper, and the
latter looked less benign. Their large
interests were centered in the mining
districts aforesaid. The "Caf&eacute; de Paris,"
enlarged and refitted, would grace any
metropolis. Its cuisine and service were
excellent, and it was furnished with all
the up-to-date conveniences and appurtenances,
including, as heretofore, a count.
Among the features of Nome are the licensed
town-criers, who parade the main
street from early morn till late at night,
calling out and advertising with original
variations the various restaurants, entertainments,
and sailings of steamers, for
which services they are very well paid.
At this time there were two steamers in
the roadstead, and tickets to Seattle were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
selling like hot cakes. The crier for one
of these vessels&mdash;a young, clean-cut-looking
fellow, evidently well educated,
and possessed of a sense of humor and a
splendid voice&mdash;was creating a good
deal of amusement by his form of appeal.
After extolling the magnificence and
speed of the ship, with solemn mien and
clear, resonant tenor voice he called out
in the crowded thoroughfare: "Get your
tickets back to mother and the old farm,
you hungry, homesick placer-miners."
This latter mode of address was of
course highly flattering to the host of
bar-room loafers.</p>

<p>The Cape Nome excitement has yielded
an abundant harvest to the transportation
companies; and, in the main, the
treatment which they have accorded their
passengers has been outrageous&mdash;in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
instances even piratical. This I know
not only from accounts of trustworthy
persons, but also from my own observation.
Vessels have been making the
long and hazardous trip which should be
condemned equally with their owners.
Narrow escapes from complete disaster
have not been infrequent, and persons
who in good faith have bought first-class
accommodations have gone aboard to
find that they have been <i>second</i> purchasers,
and, in overcrowded ships, have
been obliged to resort to the floor for
sleep, and to bribery of the stewards for
decent food. Many a chapter of horrors
incredible could be detailed by unfortunate
participants in the Nome travel. It
was with astonishment and genuine regret
that I read in a recent Nome paper
of the suicide of my cabin-mate on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
<i>St. Paul</i>, the pleasant Knight of the
Green Table. Despondent, he had deliberately
shot himself through the head.
He was a general favorite, "square" in
his "profession," and his untimely end
was widely regretted.</p>

<h4>THE END OF THE CONSPIRACY&mdash;A
WORD FOR ALASKA</h4>

<div class="figdrop">
<img src="images/dropa.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="dropa" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="caps">fter</span> having served only
three months of his year's
sentence, on the plea of ill
health and through strong
political influence, Alexander McKenzie
had been pardoned by the President, and
was again free to descend, if he chose,
upon the mining fraternity of Cape Nome.
But he showed excellent judgment in
returning to his Dakota constituency.
The Court of Appeals, in its opinion in
the McKenzie contempt cases, had in effect
declared that an outraged community had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
patiently endured injuries unparalleled in
the history of American jurisprudence,
and that the people were entitled to high
praise for their abstinence from forcible
resistance. Apropos of this, the then
senior senator from South Dakota, in his
defense in the Senate of McKenzie and
Noyes, had engaged the attention of that
body in a tirade against the honorable
court. During the winter, people had
been brooding over their grievances, and
when spring came there was frequent
mention of "necktie" parties and "shotgun"
excursions, in a way that carried
conviction of settled purposes. As a
further inducement to Mr. McKenzie to
seek other spheres of activity and usefulness,
the Circuit Court of Appeals had
made orders, and appointed an officer to
serve them, requiring Judge Noyes, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Wood, the district attorney, Mr. Geary,
the lawyer and ex-Congressman who had
advised and defended McKenzie, and one
Frost, a special agent from the Department
of Justice at Washington, to appear
in San Francisco in October, 1901, and
show cause why they, too, should not be
punished for contempt of court. After
all, there was something to be admired in
the bold dash and forceful ability of the
arch conspirator. Alexander McKenzie
might have reigned supreme until the
successful realization of the scheme or
conspiracy had he been assisted by a more
efficient and less bungling corps of lieutenants.</p>

<p>Judge Noyes, having given a scant
day's notice to the bar, departed from
Nome in August, 1901, adjourning his
court until November, and leaving legal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
matters in a state of great confusion.
The favored, however, immediately prior
to his departure, had obtained his ready
signature to various orders and injunctions;
and shortly before the vessel
weighed anchor there was a stream of
small boats plying between the shore and
the maritime court, whose passengers
were obtaining what came to be known
as "deep-sea injunctions." As a result
of a number of conflicting orders which
Judge Noyes had made pertaining to a
certain disputed mining claim, a body of
masked men some time later endeavored
by force of arms to drive away the parties
in possession, in consequence of which
there was bloodshed and enrichment of
the hospital.</p>

<p>Two petitions&mdash;one from the general
public, the other from the lawyers&mdash;were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
sent to the President seeking the
removal of Judge Noyes and the appointment
of a suitable man in his stead. The
latter petition, signed almost universally
by the bar, characterizes Judge Noyes as
"weak," "vacillating," "dilatory," "careless,"
"negligent," "partial," and "absolutely
incompetent." It should carry
additional weight by reason of the moderation
of its language. In September,
having received his instructions through
Attorney-General Knox, Judge Wickersham,
of the Third Judicial Division of
Alaska, opened a term of court during
the interregnum period; and, having entered
upon his duties with ability and
despatch, soon gained the confidence of
the community by a number of prompt,
clear-cut decisions.</p>

<p>The United States Circuit Court of Appeals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
on the sixth day of January, 1902,
filed its opinion and judgment in the contempt
cases of Arthur H. Noyes, C.A.S.
Frost, Thomas J. Geary, and Joseph K.
Wood. The opinion of the court was delivered
by Judge Gilbert, and there are
concurring opinions by Judges Ross and
Morrow, which, however, are stronger
and more severe in their expressions than
the prevailing opinion.</p>

<p>After reviewing the history of the proceedings
which have heretofore been set
forth, and commenting upon the further
evidence received on the trial, Judge
Noyes is adjudged guilty of contempt of
court in that he not only refused to compel
McKenzie to obey the writs, but, on
the other hand, made orders which prevented
their enforcement. In view of
the fact that he holds a public office,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Noyes's sentence consists of a mere fine
of one thousand dollars. As to Geary,
the lawyer, the court states that there is
not sufficient evidence to convince it beyond
a reasonable doubt that he was
guilty of contempt, and the charge against
him is dismissed. Wood, the district
attorney, is adjudged guilty, and is sentenced
to four months' imprisonment in
the county jail of Alameda County, California.
Frost, the special agent from the
Department of Justice, who (as the evidence
discloses), soon after his arrival at
Nome, became an assistant district attorney,
and, later, Judge Noyes's private
secretary, and who spent government
money in behalf of the conspirators, is
likewise found guilty of contempt of
court, and is sentenced to imprisonment
for twelve months in the county jail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p><p>Judge Ross in his concurring opinion
says:</p>

<p>"I am of the opinion that the records
and evidence in the cases show beyond
any reasonable doubt that the circumstances
under which and the purposes for
which each of those persons committed
the contempt alleged and so found were
far graver than is indicated in the opinion
of the court, and that the punishment
awarded by the court is wholly inadequate
to the gravity of the offenses. I
think the records and evidence show
very clearly that the contempts of Judge
Noyes and Frost were committed in pursuance
of a corrupt conspiracy with Alexander
McKenzie and with others, not
before the court and therefore not necessary
to be named, by which the properties
involved in the suits mentioned in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
opinion, among other properties, were to
be wrongfully taken, under the forms of
law, from the possession of those engaged
in mining them, and the proceeds thereof
appropriated by the conspirators. For
those shocking offenses it is apparent
that no punishment that can be lawfully
imposed in a contempt proceeding is adequate.
But a reasonable imprisonment
may be here imposed, and I am of the
opinion that, in the case of the respondent
Arthur H. Noyes, a judgment of imprisonment
in a county jail for the period of
eighteen months should be imposed, and
in the case of Frost a like imprisonment
of fifteen months.... I think Wood
should be imprisoned for ten months.... In
regard to the respondent Geary, I
agree with the finding of the court to the
effect that the contempt alleged against
him is not sufficiently established."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p><p>Judge Morrow concurs in the findings
contained in the opinion of Judge Gilbert,
and adds: "In my judgment the evidence
establishes the fact that there was a conspiracy
between the respondent Noyes,
McKenzie, and others to secure possession
of certain valuable mining claims at
Nome, Alaska, under proceedings involving
the appointment of a receiver, for the
purpose of working the properties and
obtaining the gold deposited in the claims.
To carry these proceedings to a supposed
successful conclusion, Noyes, McKenzie,
and others found it a necessary part of
the scheme to resist the process of this
court. In pursuance of this conspiracy,
the contempt charged against Noyes was
committed; but I agree with Judge Gilbert
that this conspiracy is outside the
charge of contempt, and in view of the
fact that the respondent Noyes holds a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
judicial position, I concur in his judgment
that the respondent be required to pay a
fine of one thousand dollars."</p>

<p>A giant conspiracy indeed, far-reaching
in its ramifications, which received its
death-blow in the arrest and sentence of
Alexander McKenzie, and which may be
said to have had its proper interment in
the recent adjudication of the Circuit
Court of Appeals. It only remains for
the President to remove from office the
judge who has so flagrantly disgraced the
federal bench, and to appoint a successor
under whose administration of justice a
marvelous mineral region will develop
with rapidity and confidence.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p><p>As this book goes to print, renewed
efforts are being made in the United
States Senate, by Messrs. Hansbrough
and McCumber of North Dakota, to "vindicate"
McKenzie and Noyes. The present
method of vindication appears to consist
mainly in attacking the intelligence
and integrity of the three eminent jurists
who constitute the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>The credit for relieving northwestern
Alaska of this judicial-receiver curse belongs
to three equally essential factors:
first, Charles D. Lane, president of the
Wild Goose Company, who had the courage
to fight the "ring" to a finish without
compromise; second, Samuel Knight, of
the San Francisco bar, through whose
ability and aggressiveness the matter was
properly and clearly brought before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
appellate court; third, the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which
promptly and fearlessly redressed, so far as
lay within its power, the wrongs that had
been perpetrated among an outraged people.
And, be the truth known, this has
been accomplished in the face of great
indifference and strong opposition at
Washington.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam's record in Alaska has not
been one to be proud of. A taxed, unrepresented
people, who, under the greatest
adversities, have shown to the world
the enormous and varied resources of a
supposedly barren land, have for years had
to bear the additional burden of incompetent
and unscrupulous officials who have
been foisted upon the country. The rush
to Cape Nome has attracted attention to
only a comparatively insignificant portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
of Alaska, and emphasized but one of the
treasures in its vast, unexplored storehouse.</p>

<p>In the north and east, and over by
the Canadian border-line, is the world-famous
Klondike region. Fifteen hundred
miles distant to the west, close to
Siberia, are the Nome gold-fields. Southeast
are found seemingly inexhaustible
quartz-gold mines, the greatest salmon-fisheries
in the world, and a climate and
soil which will make agriculture possible
and profitable. And away to the south and
west are immense forests, mines of copper,
and the Pribilof Islands, the home of the
fur-seal. Within the boundaries of Alaska
there lies a country incomprehensible in
its extent and difficulties, inconceivable in
the possibilities of its latent wealth. The
marvelous discoveries of gold at Cape
Nome, which have entailed so much hardship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and scandal, bringing riches to many
and disappointment to more, will at least
have worked a highly beneficent result in
bringing earlier to light the neglect and
needs of our wonderful Alaska.</p>
